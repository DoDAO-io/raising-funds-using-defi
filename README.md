 ## Raising Funds in DeFi
 Introductory course to learn about the new innovative techniques that can be used for raising funds in DeFi

 
 ## Description
 Traditional businesses or startups tend to follow one of several growth-based blueprints as they progress through different stages, such as pre-seed, seed, Series A, Series B, and Series C/D/IPO. Many of these companies eventually outgrow their original objectives and begin to pursue a purely financial route, focusing solely on metrics such as revenue, profits, and growth.

In how many startups do we see
- Funds being raised from the community
- Profits being shared with the community
- Important decisions taken collectively by employees and customers
- Sharing profits with customers
- Having customers as investors
- Longer term members being compensated more than short term members
- All the employees as share holders with sizeable share percentages

DeFi makes it possible for anyone to invest in a project. Early investors who take on more risk can potentially receive greater rewards. Additionally, unlike traditional VC models, investors are not locked into multi-year fund cycles. They can invest and then resell their tokens whenever they want. 

We will see many new ways that projects can raise money through DeFi or by using DeFi techniques. This will provide more opportunities for people to get involved in projects and potentially receive greater rewards for their investment.
