    ### What is a Bonding Curve?


    The Bonding Curves Offerings (BCO) provides a way for projects to
    efficiently, fairly, and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters in a
    transparent way. 


    A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship
    between price and token supply. In other words, it's a way to visualize how
    the price of a token changes as more tokens are minted. Here's an example of
    a bonding curve, where `currentPrice = tokenSupplyÂ²`:

    The Bonding Curve explains how the price of a token is determined by the
    number of tokens that have already been minted. In the case of an
    exponential curve, such as the one shown in the example, the growth rate
    will speed up as the number of tokens minted increases.


    When someone buys a token, each successive buyer will need to pay a slightly
    higher price per token, which could generate profits for the earliest
    investors. As more people learn about the project and buying continues, the
    value of each token will go up slowly along the bonding curve. As tokens
    have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a price
    advantage for early adopters. Early buyers have a considerable upside
    potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest
    when supply is low as well.


    Early buyers of tokens have a considerable upside potential when compared
    with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low. As
    tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, early adopters
    can benefit from a price advantage. By getting in early, buyers can take
    advantage of the potential for growth as prices increase as more people
    enter the market.


    The most significant advantage that Bonding Curves have over traditional
    asset pricing methods is the fact that the pricing of assets is transparent,
    set in stone(on-chain), and unchanging at all points. The market is able to
    reach a collective agreement through well-defined rules, without needing
    outside intervention. Because the cost per token is decided by the
    curve/formula, every person involved knows how much each token will cost
    ahead of time. This allows for a honest and just market where everyone knows
    the score.


    ### Buying/Minting tokens from bonding curve:

    - A bonding curve smart contract is created that allows users to buy/mint a
    new token (eg. Bonding Curve Token, BCT) with by supplying a currency for
    example USDC.

    - The price of BCT is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current
    circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, USDC.

    - By providing USDC to the contract, the user can buy the new BCT token
    through a smart contract. 

    - After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move
    along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has
    just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)


    ### Key benefits of bonding curves:

    - Limitless Supply - Normally there is no limit to the number of tokens that
    can be minted.

    - Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and
    decreases according to the number of tokens minted.

    - Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more
    than token n-1.

    - Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any
    time.

    Bonds in DeFi are quite different from Traditional Bonds


    ### Traditional Bonds

    A bond is a debt security, similar to an IOU. Borrowers issue bonds to raise
    money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of
    time.


    When you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a
    government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to
    pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to
    repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when
    it "matures," or comes due after a set period of time.


    ### DeFi Bonds

    There is a lot of difference between bonds in DeFi and traditional bonds,
    just like there is a lot of difference between tokens and stocks. In some
    cases, projects might just be using the name "bond" for particular
    offerings, but the mechanics can be totally different from traditional
    bonds.


    There are a few common mechanics that we often see being used in bonds as a
    way for DeFi projects to raise capital, these include:


    1. **Exchange of Native Token**: In return for selling their native token,
    projects will ask for a stable token or one that is less volatile in
    exchange.

    2. **Discount on Tokens**: To make the bonds more appealing, projects will
    sell them at a 

    3. **Protocol owned Liquidity**: This is often used when a project needs to
    gain access to various tokens that are utilized as part of the product. For
    instance, to demonstrate the full potential of a Decentralized Exchange or
    Lending & Borrowing, protocols require access to a great deal of liquidity
    of different tokens.

    4. **Secondary Markets**: Most of these bonds can be sold at a secondary
    market place, so the investor doesn't have to wait for the bond to mature.
