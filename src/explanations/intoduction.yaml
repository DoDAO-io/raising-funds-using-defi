    ## Traditional Fundraising

    Traditional methods of fundraising can be quite limiting and outdated, often
    not taking into consideration new techniques that could make the project
    more appealing to not just venture capitalists, but to the community or
    customers as well. Some limitations of existing fundraising methods include:


    - Projects that speak VC-friendly language can easily raise funds, limiting
    access for first time founders or creators. 

    - The process can be time-consuming and frustrating, often requiring a lot
    of upfront work with no guarantee of success. 

    - Price is set by the founders or VCs, without any price discovery. 

    - Most investment opportunities are only available to accredited investors,
    i.e. people earning more than $200,000 (or a few other constraints)


    ## DeFi Fundraising

    In DeFi projects, one or more tokens can be issued and then sold by the
    project using some of the fundraising primitives that have been developed in
    the ecosystem.  One thing to note is that many of the projects in Crypto
    might not adhere to security laws (selling of the shares/stocks in open
    market) and it is very important to do your proper research before you
    decide to use one of the DeFi primitives for fundraising. The most common
    DeFi primitives for fundraising currently used are:

    1. **Bonding Curves** - Bootstrapping funds with earlier investors being
    rewarded more lucrative than those who join the project later on.

    2. **Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming** - Offering native tokens to investors
    in exchange for providing liquidity to the protocol which can be used for
    trading, lending, or borrowing. This structure allows investors to have
    nearly full control over the funds and they can choose to exit the position
    when desired.

    3. **Staking** - Staking allows investors to deposit their funds with a
    protocol and earn interest on them. In the event of an unexpected loss of
    funds, some money may be deducted from the deposited funds. 

    4. **DeFi Bonds** - DeFi bonds are an innovative mechanism that allows
    investors to purchase tokens at a discount. Investors purchase the bonds and
    then get access to the tokens once the bond matures.

    5. **Quadratic Funding** - In this crowdfunding method, money from a central
    matching pool is allocated based on which projects are more democratically
    supported as opposed to those into which more capital goes.


    We will cover each of these funding methods in the following sections.

    ### What is a Bonding Curve?


    The Bonding Curves Offerings (BCO) provides a way for projects to
    efficiently, fairly, and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters in a
    transparent way. 


    A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship
    between price and token supply. In other words, it's a way to visualize how
    the price of a token changes as more tokens are minted. Here's an example of
    a bonding curve, where `currentPrice = tokenSupplyÂ²`:



    <img style="max-height:300px"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/simple_bonding_curve.png"
    />


    `Source: https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/`


    The Bonding Curve explains how the price of a token is determined by the
    number of tokens that have already been minted. In the case of an
    exponential curve, such as the one shown in the example, the growth rate
    will speed up as the number of tokens minted increases.


    When someone buys a token, each successive buyer will need to pay a slightly
    higher price per token, which could generate profits for the earliest
    investors. As more people learn about the project and buying continues, the
    value of each token will go up slowly along the bonding curve. As tokens
    have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a price
    advantage for early adopters. Early buyers have a considerable upside
    potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest
    when supply is low as well.


    Early buyers of tokens have a considerable upside potential when compared
    with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low. As
    tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, early adopters
    can benefit from a price advantage. By getting in early, buyers can take
    advantage of the potential for growth as prices increase as more people
    enter the market.


    The most significant advantage that Bonding Curves have over traditional
    asset pricing methods is the fact that the pricing of assets is transparent,
    set in stone(on-chain), and unchanging at all points. The market is able to
    reach a collective agreement through well-defined rules, without needing
    outside intervention. Because the cost per token is decided by the
    curve/formula, every person involved knows how much each token will cost
    ahead of time. This allows for a honest and just market where everyone knows
    the score.


    ### Buying/Minting tokens from bonding curve:

    - A bonding curve smart contract is created that allows users to buy/mint a
    new token (eg. Bonding Curve Token, ABC) with by supplying a currency for
    example USDC.

    - The price of ABC is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current
    circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, USDC.

    - By providing USDC to the contract, the user can buy the new ABC token
    through a smart contract. 

    - After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move
    along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has
    just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)

    - A ABC holder can choose to burn or sell their token back to the curve at
    any time. If the price of the token goes up after they purchase it, they
    will likely sell it at a profit (minus gas and fees). They will receive the
    bonded USDC back from the smart contract after their sell is approved.



    ### Key benefits of bonding curves:

    - Limitless Supply - Normally there is no limit to the number of tokens that
    can be minted.

    - Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and
    decreases according to the number of tokens minted.

    - Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more
    than token n-1.

    - Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any
    time.


    ### Limitations

    * Basic forms of bonding curves don't keep a minimal reserve that might be
    needed to bootstrap the project.

    * Users can buy or sell the tokens to the bonding curve, but minting of new
    tokens based on time schedule is not possible. This could be an issue for
    new projects that need to compensate for an initial burn rate.


    ### Augmented Bonding Curves

    The most basic form of a bonding curve is "x = y." By adding more variables
    or constraints to the formula, you can make the bonding curve more suitable
    to the needs of your project. The Augmented Bonding Curve, explained below,
    is one such example of how bonding curves can be extended.


    The Augmented Bonding Curve design can be conceptualized as a typical
    bonding curve with the addition of a funding pool, a token lock-up/vesting
    mechanism, and inter-system feedback loops. The system is launched in two
    stages: the Hatch Phase and the Open Phase.


    <img style="max-height:600px"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/augmented_bonding_curve.png"
    />


    `Source:
    https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751`


    The Hatch Phase is designed to allow initial contributors (founding members,
    devoted contributors, initial investors, etc.) to participate in a hatch
    sale. The purpose of this phase is to gather contributors and pool capital.
    A percentage of the capital is put into the Reserve Pool and used to mint
    tokens and determine the initial spot price during the Open Phase. The
    remaining capital in the Funding Pool is un-bonded and can be distributed as
    real capital outside of the bonding curve.


    In a typical bonding curve system, the tokens can be burned at any time.
    However, in an augmented bonding curve system, the tokens minted during the
    Hatch Phase are locked and cannot be burned. This is to prevent any early
    speculation or arbitrage that could affect the stability of the Reserve
    Pool. It's important to have funds locked early on in the system to make
    sure that the capital in the Funding Pool is allocated to community
    initiatives, research projects and development milestones that will help the
    commons grow.


    Once the goal for the Hatch Sale is reached, the new tokens go into a
    reserve pool where they can be bought or sold according to the bonding
    curve. The Hatchers tokens are gradually unlocked through this vesting
    process.


    Whenever tokens are burned, an exit tax is enacted on liquidation. As
    members "cash out" and liquidate their funds, a small percentage of their
    returns are sent back into the funding pool, allowing for the simultaneous
    funding of the commons while contributors are earning returns. This means
    that the system always benefits - even if speculators are just looking to
    make a quick return.

    Liquidity mining and yield farming are two terms that are often used
    interchangeably in DeFi. 


    There are currently more than 50 DEXs and 50 lending and borrowing
    protocols, but only a few of each have achieved significant adoption. These
    platforms face a chicken and an egg problem, i.e. the more liquidity (funds)
    they have, the better the trade will be, and the more users will come to
    their protocol, which will further increase the funds and liquidity on the
    protocol.


    Not just the amount of a crypto currently, but also the number of crypto
    currencies supported on a protocol also matters a lot. So to attract
    investors to bring money, most of these protocols offer rewards and share
    percentage of their fees. Rewards offered to the protocols are mostly the
    percentage of the trading fee and rewarding their native token. For example,
    0x protocol offers ZRX tokens as rewards to its investors.


    In the summer of 2020 and in 2021, we saw an influx of new projects offering
    investors and users huge rewards in order to attract them to their
    protocols. Most of these projects are in competition with one another, so
    investors have been able to take advantage of this by moving their funds
    around to different protocols and earning high rewards. As the rewards
    decreased or if another platform offered more attractive rewards, investors
    moved their funds again.


    ## Drawbacks of Liquidity Mining

    There are several drawbacks to attracting liquidity simply by giving native
    tokens in exchange:

    1. The liquidity providers are not motivated to help the protocol grow in
    the long term, so they may move to other protocols that offer better
    short-term rewards.

    2. By giving away native tokens, protocols increase the total supply of
    their tokens in the market, which can cause prices to drop.

    3. Even after providing heavy rewards, the investors remain in full control
    of the liquidity and can choose to leave the protocol at any time.


    There are two common designs that different projects have adopted to combat
    this problem:


    1. **Protocol Owned Liquidity** - Using this protocols sell their native
    tokens in the form of bonds at a discounted price in exchange for the needed
    assets. Bonds generally have a maturity date or vesting schedule towards
    distribution of native tokens. This mechanism is covered in detail in one of
    the following chapters. 


    2. **veToken Model** - The veToken Model is a way of distributing newly
    minted tokens to investors who buy the native token of the project and lock
    it up for a certain period of time. This act of locking up the token proves
    that the investor believes in the long term success of the protocol and
    shows their commitment to the project. This model was first introduced by
    Curve protocol.

  title: Staking
  shortTitle: Staking
  details: >-

    ## Background

    Most enterprises need coverage for unforeseen events that could lead to
    financial losses, and this coverage is typically provided by insurance
    providers or investors. However, with the advent of decentralized finance
    (DeFi) protocols, it is now possible for anyone to stake/provide their funds
    to be used for the coverage of such losses. In return, the protocols usually
    reward these investors with either their native currency or some other form
    of compensation, in order to account for the risk they take by staking their
    funds.


    ## What is Staking?

    Staking is the process of holding and locking up digital assets, such as
    cryptocurrencies, as a means of providing security for a protocol. By
    staking their assets, investors can earn rewards in the form of new tokens,
    interest, or other incentives. The specifics of staking can differ depending
    on the protocol, but it is generally a way for users to earn a return on
    their crypto assets while supporting the project.


    ## Examples

    Following are two of the many options where protocols using staking
    mechanism to raise funds


    #### **Aave** 

    The Aave Safety Module (SM) is a Smart Contract-based component that allows
    Aave holders to lock their tokens. This locked AAVE will be used as a way to
    help mitigate any Shortfall Events that may occur within the money markets
    of the Aave ecosystem. A Shortfall Event is defined as a deficit, and the
    interpretation or occurrence of such an event is subject to Protocol
    Governance vote.


    If a Shortfall Event occurs, part of the locked AAVE is auctioned off on the
    market to be sold in order to cover the deficit that occurred. The Safety
    Module has a built-in backstop mechanism in place to prevent an excess flow
    of AAVE into the open market, which would further reduce the value of AAVE.
    Participants who lock AAVE into the Safety Module are effectively accepting
    the possibility of a Shortfall Event occurring, in exchange for receiving
    rewards in the form of Safety Incentives.


    #### **Sherlock** 

    When you stake USDC with Sherlock for a fixed term(6 months, 12 months
    etc.), you earn a market-leading APY in exchange for the risk that your
    funds could be used to pay out an exploit at a covered protocol. The APY for
    a staker is made up of three streams:

    1) Premiums from protocol customers

    2) Interest earned from depositing staker funds into yield strategies (Aave,
    Compound, etc.)

    3) Incentive rewards paid in SHER (Sherlockâs governance token)

    Bonds in DeFi are quite different from Traditional Bonds


    ### Traditional Bonds

    A bond is a debt security, similar to an IOU. Borrowers issue bonds to raise
    money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of
    time.


    When you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a
    government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to
    pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to
    repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when
    it "matures," or comes due after a set period of time.


    ### DeFi Bonds

    There is a lot of difference between bonds in DeFi and traditional bonds,
    just like there is a lot of difference between tokens and stocks. In some
    cases, projects might just be using the name "bond" for particular
    offerings, but the mechanics can be totally different from traditional
    bonds.


    There are a few common mechanics that we often see being used in bonds as a
    way for DeFi projects to raise capital, these include:


    1. **Exchange of Native Token**: In return for selling their native token,
    projects will ask for a stable token or one that is less volatile in
    exchange.

    2. **Discount on Tokens**: To make the bonds more appealing, projects will
    sell them at a 

    3. **Protocol owned Liquidity**: This is often used when a project needs to
    gain access to various tokens that are utilized as part of the product. For
    instance, to demonstrate the full potential of a Decentralized Exchange or
    Lending & Borrowing, protocols require access to a great deal of liquidity
    of different tokens.

    4. **Secondary Markets**: Most of these bonds can be sold at a secondary
    market place, so the investor doesn't have to wait for the bond to mature.

    ## Quadratic Funding

    https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1220


    Created by Glen Wyel at Microsoft and Vitalik Buterin founder of Ethereum,
    with this mechanism you have a crowdfunding campaign that is allocated
    dollars from a central matching pool based on which projects are more
    democratically supported as opposed to those into which more capital goes.
    It is in opposition to 1:1 as that is plutocratic and based only on capital
    needs. It is instead based on the number of contributors as opposed to the
    amount funded, reducing whale power and favoring democratic.

    Example: You raise a grant that gets $100 from 100 contributors, and I raise
    a grant that gets $100 from 1 contributor, despite both grants being donated
    $100, you will get 99% of the matching pool. Itâs a cool mechanism because
    it is a collective intelligence mechanism that routes money to where the 
    âpoor and the manyâ have an advantage over the rich and the few.


    You may give âonlyâ a dollar, but really you are part of building an
    aggregate signal of what public goods folks want to see funded. Problems:

    * sybil attacks, needing to raise matching pool funds.

    * Itâs like voting! Mitigating a plutocratic methodology with a one person:
    one vote identity style.



    ## Retroactive Public Goods Funding 

    https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1680


    Karl Floersch is an inspiration for this mechanism, as they are implementing
    it at Optimism. It is a way of doing public goods funding retroactively. At
    Optimism, they are creating a committee of experts, and theyâre channeling
    revenue from the Optimism network and asking that committee of experts which
    things in the past have delivered value to the ecosystem. The idea is that
    more talent will be directed toward developing public goods funding in the
    present based on the assurance that they will be rewarded for it in the
    future.


    ## Hypercerts 

    https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=2680

    Owocki is working on this mechanism with Protocol Labs. Carbon credits have
    market value; Hypercerts can generalize the magic of carbon credits into any
    impact vector. For example, I fix some potholes or pick up x-amount trash,
    etc. Any impact DAO could issue Hypercerts when their members have positive
    impact, and then bootstrap a marketplace of impact evaluators and get people
    who want to collect Hypercerts to show their virtue. Web2 =
    virtue-signaling. Web3 = proof-of-virtue.


    So weâre bootstrapping a triple-sided marketplace, where impact DAOs can
    issue Hypercerts, impact evaluators can stamp their legitimacy, and people
    who care can purchase them. Sum value is that any impact DAO can go from
    worrying about how much impact they can capture to how much they can create.
    That systematically shifts the incentives towards impact DAOs to having a
    business model, which means more capital and talent can rotate into impact
    DAOs. If you can create a decentralized signal generation collective
    intelligence marketplace, where people are issuing, evaluating and
    purchasing Hypercerts, you can have a decentralized data source about the
    impact.


    Challenge: why havenât they worked in the past? Impact markets arenât new.
    Owocki thinks the decentralized, blockchain aspect will make it reliable and
    successful. Bootstrapping the buy pressure will be the hardest part. We need
    to use social and cultural power to collect these things, then theyâll be
    successful. The dream is to create a market around it.
