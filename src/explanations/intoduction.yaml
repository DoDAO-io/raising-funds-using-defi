    ### What is a Bonding Curve?


    The Bonding Curves Offerings (BCO) provides a way for projects to
    efficiently, fairly, and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters in a
    transparent way. 


    A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship
    between price and token supply. In other words, it's a way to visualize how
    the price of a token changes as more tokens are minted. Here's an example of
    a bonding curve, where `currentPrice = tokenSupplyÂ²`:

    The Bonding Curve explains how the price of a token is determined by the
    number of tokens that have already been minted. In the case of an
    exponential curve, such as the one shown in the example, the growth rate
    will speed up as the number of tokens minted increases.


    When someone buys a token, each successive buyer will need to pay a slightly
    higher price per token, which could generate profits for the earliest
    investors. As more people learn about the project and buying continues, the
    value of each token will go up slowly along the bonding curve. As tokens
    have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a price
    advantage for early adopters. Early buyers have a considerable upside
    potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest
    when supply is low as well.


    Early buyers of tokens have a considerable upside potential when compared
    with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low. As
    tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, early adopters
    can benefit from a price advantage. By getting in early, buyers can take
    advantage of the potential for growth as prices increase as more people
    enter the market.


    The most significant advantage that Bonding Curves have over traditional
    asset pricing methods is the fact that the pricing of assets is transparent,
    set in stone(on-chain), and unchanging at all points. The market is able to
    reach a collective agreement through well-defined rules, without needing
    outside intervention. Because the cost per token is decided by the
    curve/formula, every person involved knows how much each token will cost
    ahead of time. This allows for a honest and just market where everyone knows
    the score.


    ### Typical flow of a bonding curve interaction:

    - A smart contract is created that allows users to mint/buy a new token (eg.
    Bonding Curve Token, BCT) with a specified reserve currency (let's say DAI).

    - The price of BCT is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current
    circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, DAI.

    - With the reserve currency, the user can buy the new BCT token through a
    smart contract. The sold DAI is kept in the smart contract as collateral and
    not dispersed to any person or team.

    - After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move
    along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has
    just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)

    - At any point, a BCT holder can decide to burn/sell their token back to the
    curve. If the price continues to go up after their initial purchase, the
    user will likely sell at a profit (minus gas and fees). The user will
    receive back the bonded DAI from the smart contract after their sell is
    approved.


    ### Key features and benefits of bonding curves:

    - Limitless Supply - There is no limit to the number of tokens that can be
    minted.

    - Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and
    decreases according to the number of tokens minted.

    - Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more
    than token n-1.

    - Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any
    time.
