    ### What is a Bonding Curve?

    Bonding Curves Offerings, or BCOs, allow projects to efficiently, fairly,
    and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters, who fund and speculate
    on new business ventures in a transparent way.

    They are built upon one of the most fundamental concepts in economics: price
    being a function of supply and demand. This tried and tested economic law is
    the complex study of a more familiar adage: an asset is only worth what
    someone is willing to pay for it.

    The Bonding Curve ensures that each newly minted token (which is sold to a
    buyer in the market), is more expensive than the previous token. Because the
    price of each token is defined by the curve / formula itself, every market
    participant knows exactly how much each token will cost at any given time.
    As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a
    price advantage for early adopters.

    Early buyers have a considerable upside potential when compared with later
    entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low as well.

    The most fundamental advantage of Bonding Curves over traditional asset
    pricing mechanisms is that the pricing of assets is transparent, defined,
    and immutable at all stages. The market is able to reach the equilibrium of
    consensus through clearly defined rules, without third-party intervention.

    Additionally, this fundraising method addresses many of the inefficiencies
    that have led to fraud and misappropriation within the Initial Coin Offering
    (ICO) model. Starting offer prices are not set arbitrarily by the project's
    founders. All tokens are accounted for at all times. The tokenâ€™s
    distribution is automatic and configurable.
