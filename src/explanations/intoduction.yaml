    ### What is a Bonding Curve?

    Bonding Curves Offerings, or BCOs, allow projects to efficiently, fairly,
    and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters, who fund and speculate
    on new business ventures in a transparent way.

    They are built upon one of the most fundamental concepts in economics: price
    being a function of supply and demand. This tried and tested economic law is
    the complex study of a more familiar adage: an asset is only worth what
    someone is willing to pay for it.

    The Bonding Curve ensures that each newly minted token (which is sold to a
    buyer in the market), is more expensive than the previous token. Because the
    price of each token is defined by the curve / formula itself, every market
    participant knows exactly how much each token will cost at any given time.
    As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a
    price advantage for early adopters.

    Early buyers have a considerable upside potential when compared with later
    entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low as well.

    The most fundamental advantage of Bonding Curves over traditional asset
    pricing mechanisms is that the pricing of assets is transparent, defined,
    and immutable at all stages. The market is able to reach the equilibrium of
    consensus through clearly defined rules, without third-party intervention.

    Additionally, this fundraising method addresses many of the inefficiencies
    that have led to fraud and misappropriation within the Initial Coin Offering
    (ICO) model. Starting offer prices are not set arbitrarily by the project's
    founders. All tokens are accounted for at all times. The tokenâ€™s
    distribution is automatic and configurable. 


    ### Typical flow of a bonding curve interaction:

    - A smart contract is created that allows users to mint/buy a new token (eg.
    Bonding Curve Token, BCT) with a specified reserve currency (let's say DAI).

    - The price of BCT is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current
    circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, DAI.

    - With the reserve currency, the user can buy the new BCT token through a
    smart contract. The sold DAI is kept in the smart contract as collateral and
    not dispersed to any person or team.

    - After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move
    along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has
    just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)

    - At any point, a BCT holder can decide to burn/sell their token back to the
    curve. If the price continues to go up after their initial purchase, the
    user will likely sell at a profit (minus gas and fees). The user will
    receive back the bonded DAI from the smart contract after their sell is
    approved.


    ### Key features and benefits of bonding curves:

    - Limitless Supply - There is no limit to the number of tokens that can be
    minted.

    - Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and
    decreases according to the number of tokens minted.

    - Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more
    than token n-1.

    - Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any
    time.
