    ## Traditional Fundraising

    Traditional methods of fundraising can be quite limiting and outdated, often
    not taking into consideration new techniques that could make the project
    more appealing to not just venture capitalists, but to the community or
    customers as well. Some limitations of existing fundraising methods include:


    - Projects that speak VC-friendly language can easily raise funds, limiting
    access for first time founders or creators. 

    - The process can be time-consuming and frustrating, often requiring a lot
    of upfront work with no guarantee of success. 

    - Price is set by the founders or VCs, without any price discovery. 

    - Most investment opportunities are only available to accredited investors,
    i.e. people earning more than $200,000 (or a few other constraints)


    ## DeFi Fundraising

    In DeFi projects, one or more tokens can be issued and then sold by the
    project using some of the fundraising primitives that have been developed in
    the ecosystem.  One thing to note is that many of the projects in Crypto
    might not adhere to security laws (selling of the shares/stocks in open
    market) and it is very important to do your proper research before you
    decide to use one of the DeFi primitives for fundraising. The most common
    DeFi primitives for fundraising currently used are:

    1. **Bonding Curves** - Bootstrapping funds with earlier investors being
    rewarded more lucrative than those who join the project later on.

    2. **Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming** - Offering native tokens to investors
    in exchange for providing liquidity to the protocol which can be used for
    trading, lending, or borrowing. This structure allows investors to have
    nearly full control over the funds and they can choose to exit the position
    when desired.

    3. **Staking** - Staking allows investors to deposit their funds with a
    protocol and earn interest on them. In the event of an unexpected loss of
    funds, some money may be deducted from the deposited funds. 

    4. **DeFi Bonds** - DeFi bonds are an innovative mechanism that allows
    investors to purchase tokens at a discount. Investors purchase the bonds and
    then get access to the tokens once the bond matures.

    5. **Quadratic Funding** - In this crowdfunding method, money from a central
    matching pool is allocated based on which projects are more democratically
    supported as opposed to those into which more capital goes.


    We will cover each of these funding methods in the following sections.

    ### What is a Bonding Curve?


    The Bonding Curves Offerings (BCO) provides a way for projects to
    efficiently, fairly, and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters in a
    transparent way. 


    A bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship
    between price and token supply. In other words, it's a way to visualize how
    the price of a token changes as more tokens are minted. Here's an example of
    a bonding curve, where `currentPrice = tokenSupply²`:



    <img style="max-height:300px"

    />


    `Source: https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/`


    The Bonding Curve explains how the price of a token is determined by the
    number of tokens that have already been minted. In the case of an
    exponential curve, such as the one shown in the example, the growth rate
    will speed up as the number of tokens minted increases.


    When someone buys a token, each successive buyer will need to pay a slightly
    higher price per token, which could generate profits for the earliest
    investors. As more people learn about the project and buying continues, the
    value of each token will go up slowly along the bonding curve. As tokens
    have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a price
    advantage for early adopters. Early buyers have a considerable upside
    potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest
    when supply is low as well.


    Early buyers of tokens have a considerable upside potential when compared
    with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low. As
    tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, early adopters
    can benefit from a price advantage. By getting in early, buyers can take
    advantage of the potential for growth as prices increase as more people
    enter the market.


    The most significant advantage that Bonding Curves have over traditional
    asset pricing methods is the fact that the pricing of assets is transparent,
    set in stone(on-chain), and unchanging at all points. The market is able to
    reach a collective agreement through well-defined rules, without needing
    outside intervention. Because the cost per token is decided by the
    curve/formula, every person involved knows how much each token will cost
    ahead of time. This allows for a honest and just market where everyone knows
    the score.


    ### Buying/Minting tokens from bonding curve:

    - A bonding curve smart contract is created that allows users to buy/mint a
    new token (eg. Bonding Curve Token, BCT) with by supplying a currency for
    example USDC.

    - The price of BCT is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current
    circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, USDC.

    - By providing USDC to the contract, the user can buy the new BCT token
    through a smart contract. 

    - After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move
    along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has
    just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)


    ### Key benefits of bonding curves:

    - Limitless Supply - Normally there is no limit to the number of tokens that
    can be minted.

    - Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and
    decreases according to the number of tokens minted.

    - Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more
    than token n-1.

    - Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any
    time.


    ### Augmented Bonding Curves

    The Augmented Bonding Curve design can be conceptualized as a typical
    bonding curve with the addition of a funding pool, a token lock-up/vesting
    mechanism, and inter-system feedback loops. The system is launched in two
    stages: the Hatch Phase and the Open Phase.


    <img style="max-height:600px"
    src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/augmented_bonding_curve.png"
    />

    `Source:
    https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751`


    During the Hatch Phase, initial contributors (i.e. founding members of the
    organization, devoted contributors, initial investors or “Hatchers”)
    participate in a hatch sale. The point of this phase is to gather
    contributors and pool capita. A percentage is put into the Reserve Pool and
    “bonded” to the curve (i.e. minting tokens and determining the initial spot
    price used during the Open Phase) and a percentage is put into the Funding
    Pool. The capital in the Funding Pool remains un-bonded as a floating source
    of capital that can be distributed as real capital outside of the bonding
    curve. For their contribution, Hatchers receive newly minted tokens,
    specific to the Commons, in return.


    In a typical bonding curve system, these tokens could then be burned at any
    point or after an arbitrary temporal deadline. In an augmented bonding curve
    system, tokens minted during the Hatch Phase are locked (burning is
    disabled) in a vesting process. This vesting period combats any harmful
    early speculation/arbitrage that would affect the stability of the Reserve
    Pool. Although burning tokens to withdraw DAI is disabled, Hatchers’ tokens
    are far from useless — they can still be used to curate options for future
    capital allocation. Early in the system, this token usage is critical to
    ensure the capital in the Funding Pool is allocated to community
    initiatives, research projects and development milestones which will help
    grow the commons.


    After the goal for the Hatch Sale is met, the vesting process is initialized
    and the system enters the Open Phase. In the Open Phase, anyone can mint
    tokens by contributing DAI into the curve, hence becoming ‘members of the
    Commons’. Their contribution will go directly into the Reserve Pool,
    returning newly minted unlocked tokens that can be burned or used to vote
    within the system. For the Hatchers, the first inter-system feedback loop
    comes into play. The Hatchers tokens are slowly unlocked in correlation to
    how much capital has been allocated to fund projects that support the
    commons. This means that for the Hatchers’ tokens to vest, capital from the
    Funding Pool has to be allocated to fund projects that positively impact the
    commons. With this vesting process and introduction of a governance model
    (we will be exploring Conviction Voting), members of the Commons (token
    holders), are economically incentivized to participate in the system’s
    governance process to allocate funding to curated projects that have the
    most beneficial impact on the Commons. This combats a known incentive
    misalignment observed in capital-allocating DAOs — in which capital
    allocations are rare because members are too selective or stingy with funds.


    Finally, whenever tokens are burned (withdrawn for DAI → $), an exit tax is
    enacted on liquidation. As Members “cash out” and liquidate their tokens for
    DAI, a small percentage of their returns are sent back into the Funding
    Pool, allowing for the simultaneous funding of the commons while
    contributors are earning returns. This means the system always benefits,
    even if speculators are just looking to make returns.


    The goal of the system is to attract new members of the Commons that see the
    impact of the Commons and want to be a part of the movement so that the
    Funding Pool can grow.

    ## Liquidity Mining

    Liquidity mining is a process where users can earn rewards for providing
    liquidity to a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, typically by holding
    and trading a specific asset or group of assets within a liquidity pool. The
    rewards are typically paid out in the form of the platform's native token,
    and are designed to incentivize users to help increase the liquidity of the
    platform. This can help to improve the overall functioning of the platform,
    making it more attractive to other users and helping to drive further
    adoption.


    ## Yield Farming

    Yield farming is a type of liquidity mining that involves providing
    liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in order to earn returns
    in the form of various cryptocurrencies. Yield farming typically involves
    lending, borrowing, or staking assets in order to earn interest, receive
    dividends, or earn other types of returns. It is often done through smart
    contracts on blockchain platforms, which automate the process and provide
    transparency and security. The term "yield farming" is used because the
    returns earned through these activities can be quite high, similar to the
    returns earned through traditional farming.


    ## Liquidity Mining vs Yield Farming

    The main difference between liquidity mining and yield farming is that
    liquidity mining typically refers to the process of providing liquidity to a
    decentralized finance (DeFi) platform in order to earn rewards, while yield
    farming specifically refers to the process of providing liquidity in order
    to earn high returns through lending, borrowing, or staking assets.


    Both liquidity mining and yield farming are used to incentivize users to
    help increase the liquidity of a DeFi platform, but yield farming is more
    focused on the earning of high returns, and the term "yield farming" is
    often used to emphasize the high returns earned through the process.


    Another point to note is that liquidity mining is not limited to DeFi, it
    could be used in traditional finance too, while yield farming is specific to
    DeFi ecosystem





- key: staking
  shortTitle: Staking
  details: >-
    Staking refers to the process of holding and locking up digital assets, such
    as cryptocurrencies, as collateral in order to earn a return on investment
    (ROI). This is typically done in order to provide security for a network or
    to vote on governance decisions for a decentralized platform. By staking
    their assets, users can earn rewards in the form of new tokens, interest, or
    other incentives. The specific details of staking can vary depending on the
    platform, but it is a way for users to earn a return on their crypto assets
    while supporting the network.

    Bonds in DeFi are quite different from Traditional Bonds


    ### Traditional Bonds

    A bond is a debt security, similar to an IOU. Borrowers issue bonds to raise
    money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of
    time.


    When you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a
    government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to
    pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to
    repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when
    it "matures," or comes due after a set period of time.


    ### DeFi Bonds

    There is a lot of difference between bonds in DeFi and traditional bonds,
    just like there is a lot of difference between tokens and stocks. In some
    cases, projects might just be using the name "bond" for particular
    offerings, but the mechanics can be totally different from traditional
    bonds.


    There are a few common mechanics that we often see being used in bonds as a
    way for DeFi projects to raise capital, these include:


    1. **Exchange of Native Token**: In return for selling their native token,
    projects will ask for a stable token or one that is less volatile in
    exchange.

    2. **Discount on Tokens**: To make the bonds more appealing, projects will
    sell them at a 

    3. **Protocol owned Liquidity**: This is often used when a project needs to
    gain access to various tokens that are utilized as part of the product. For
    instance, to demonstrate the full potential of a Decentralized Exchange or
    Lending & Borrowing, protocols require access to a great deal of liquidity
    of different tokens.

    4. **Secondary Markets**: Most of these bonds can be sold at a secondary
    market place, so the investor doesn't have to wait for the bond to mature.

    ## Quadratic Funding

    https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1220


    Created by Glen Wyel at Microsoft and Vitalik Buterin founder of Ethereum,
    with this mechanism you have a crowdfunding campaign that is allocated
    dollars from a central matching pool based on which projects are more
    democratically supported as opposed to those into which more capital goes.
    It is in opposition to 1:1 as that is plutocratic and based only on capital
    needs. It is instead based on the number of contributors as opposed to the
    amount funded, reducing whale power and favoring democratic.

    Example: You raise a grant that gets $100 from 100 contributors, and I raise
    a grant that gets $100 from 1 contributor, despite both grants being donated
    $100, you will get 99% of the matching pool. It’s a cool mechanism because
    it is a collective intelligence mechanism that routes money to where the 
    “poor and the many” have an advantage over the rich and the few.


    You may give “only” a dollar, but really you are part of building an
    aggregate signal of what public goods folks want to see funded. Problems:

    * sybil attacks, needing to raise matching pool funds.

    * It’s like voting! Mitigating a plutocratic methodology with a one person:
    one vote identity style.



    ## Retroactive Public Goods Funding 

    https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1680


    Karl Floersch is an inspiration for this mechanism, as they are implementing
    it at Optimism. It is a way of doing public goods funding retroactively. At
    Optimism, they are creating a committee of experts, and they’re channeling
    revenue from the Optimism network and asking that committee of experts which
    things in the past have delivered value to the ecosystem. The idea is that
    more talent will be directed toward developing public goods funding in the
    present based on the assurance that they will be rewarded for it in the
    future.


    ## Hypercerts 

    https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=2680

    Owocki is working on this mechanism with Protocol Labs. Carbon credits have
    market value; Hypercerts can generalize the magic of carbon credits into any
    impact vector. For example, I fix some potholes or pick up x-amount trash,
    etc. Any impact DAO could issue Hypercerts when their members have positive
    impact, and then bootstrap a marketplace of impact evaluators and get people
    who want to collect Hypercerts to show their virtue. Web2 =
    virtue-signaling. Web3 = proof-of-virtue.


    So we’re bootstrapping a triple-sided marketplace, where impact DAOs can
    issue Hypercerts, impact evaluators can stamp their legitimacy, and people
    who care can purchase them. Sum value is that any impact DAO can go from
    worrying about how much impact they can capture to how much they can create.
    That systematically shifts the incentives towards impact DAOs to having a
    business model, which means more capital and talent can rotate into impact
    DAOs. If you can create a decentralized signal generation collective
    intelligence marketplace, where people are issuing, evaluating and
    purchasing Hypercerts, you can have a decentralized data source about the
    impact.


    Challenge: why haven’t they worked in the past? Impact markets aren’t new.
    Owocki thinks the decentralized, blockchain aspect will make it reliable and
    successful. Bootstrapping the buy pressure will be the hardest part. We need
    to use social and cultural power to collect these things, then they’ll be
    successful. The dream is to create a market around it.
