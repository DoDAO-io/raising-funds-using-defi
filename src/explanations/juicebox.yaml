    Juicebox is a versatile crypto financing protocol that allows you to
    customize various aspects of it to fit your needs. It serves as a blockchain
    equivalent of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter, Patreon, and
    Gofundme, or even a substitute for venture capital. The basic principle of
    the protocol is that when individuals invest in your project, they receive
    tokens specific to your project. These tokens can be utilized for governance
    or access to token-restricted websites. 


    ### **Managing Funds**


    As the project creator, you have the ability to distribute funds to the
    wallets or projects of your choice, which you can change over time. If
    contributors are unhappy with the direction of the project, they can
    exchange their tokens for a proportional share of the ETH stored in the
    project. You have control over various mechanics such as token issuance
    rates, redemption rates, distributions, and other project details, giving
    you full flexibility in shaping the tokenomics of your project. These rules
    put in place build trust for communities and make it hard for projects to
    rug pull or try to scam people of their investments. Supporters and members
    of communities can easily believe in projects and what they want to achieve.


    ### **Building Trust**


    Additionally, you can lock in your settings for a set period, ensuring your
    community that you won't make any sudden changes. Juicebox offers you the
    choice to retain control or relinquish it when necessary. Built on Ethereum,
    Juicebox provides the platform for individuals to pay projects to either own
    their tokens or NFTs. As earlier mentioned, these tokens can be governance
    tokens of DAOs ie. being used to create proposals or vote on them depending
    on the voting structures that are in place within the DAO, they may also be
    a form of compensation for contributors or even a way to provide membership
    perks to community members. Every project has a unique way to use Juicebox
    depending on the peculiarity of the project.


    ### **Community Development**


    Finally, one of the key things to look out for in communities as they grow
    is if they are flexible to adapt to changes over time. This is why Juicebox
    lets projects adapt their rules and conditions as projects grow and members
    increase. Juicebox also integrates nicely with other tools such as Gnosis
    Safe, Snapshot, and other tools that various communities use to operate.
    With these in place, projects can rely on Juicebox for scalability.
