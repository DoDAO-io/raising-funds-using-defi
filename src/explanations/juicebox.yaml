    Juicebox is a versatile crypto financing protocol that allows you to
    customize various aspects of it to fit your needs. It serves as a blockchain
    equivalent of crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter, Patreon, and
    Gofundme, or even a substitute for venture capital. The basic principle of
    the protocol is that when individuals invest in your project, they receive
    tokens specific to your project. These tokens can be utilized for governance
    or access to token-restricted websites. 


    ### **Managing Funds**


    As the project creator, you have the ability to distribute funds to the
    wallets or projects of your choice, which you can change over time. If
    contributors are unhappy with the direction of the project, they can
    exchange their tokens for a proportional share of the ETH stored in the
    project. You have control over various mechanics such as token issuance
    rates, redemption rates, distributions, and other project details, giving
    you full flexibility in shaping the tokenomics of your project. These rules
    put in place build trust for communities and make it hard for projects to
    rug pull or try to scam people of their investments. Supporters and members
    of communities can easily believe in projects and what they want to achieve.


    ### **Building Trust**


    Additionally, you can lock in your settings for a set period, ensuring your
    community that you won't make any sudden changes. Juicebox offers you the
    choice to retain control or relinquish it when necessary. Built on Ethereum,
    Juicebox provides the platform for individuals to pay projects to either own
    their tokens or NFTs. As earlier mentioned, these tokens can be governance
    tokens of DAOs ie. being used to create proposals or vote on them depending
    on the voting structures that are in place within the DAO, they may also be
    a form of compensation for contributors or even a way to provide membership
    perks to community members. Every project has a unique way to use Juicebox
    depending on the peculiarity of the project.


    ### **Community Development**


    Finally, one of the key things to look out for in communities as they grow
    is if they are flexible to adapt to changes over time. This is why Juicebox
    lets projects adapt their rules and conditions as projects grow and members
    increase. Juicebox also integrates nicely with other tools such as Gnosis
    Safe, Snapshot, and other tools that various communities use to operate.
    With these in place, projects can rely on Juicebox for scalability.

  shortTitle: Setting Up
  details: >-
    Starting out on Juicebox is simply following a number of steps, the first is
    creating a project on Juicebox. To create a project on Juicebox, visit,
    [https://juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) and click on ‘Create A
    Project’. In this course, we will be creating a project so you can follow
    the steps highlighted below. In this case, we will be using the Juicebox
    testnet on Goerli via
    [https://goerli.juicebox.money](https://goerli.juicebox.money) 


    1. Connect your wallet address on the Goerli network to get started.

    ![Available
    Wallets](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/available_wallets.jpg)


    2. Input the project details. These details are information such as the
    project name, project description, logo, project links, owner of the
    project, and customize pay button. Some of the fields are optional so you
    don’t have to fill them.

    ![Project
    Details](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/project_details.jpg)


    3. The next is to set the funding cycle for the project. On Juicebox, a
    funding cycle is a period where the settings are locked in before any change
    is made. This helps to build trust among contributors and community members
    knowing that for that period, no change to the rules of the token can be
    made. The default on Juicebox is 14 days if you select the automated funding
    cycle. Projects can however customize their funding cycles and put their own
    number of days if they choose the manual funding cycle.

    ![Funding
    Cycles](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/funding_cycles.jpg)


    4. Depending on the project, you can choose if the target for the funds
    being raised is specific where a portion of the funds is distributed to
    specific wallet addresses or an infinite target where the project holds all
    the funds.

    ![Funding
    Target](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/funding_target.jpg)


    5. The next step is to set the wallets that the payouts from the funds will
    be sent. This allows the project to allocate funds to various wallets in
    form of percentages or specific amounts (if the specific funding target was
    chosen). We will choose the project owner since that’s the wallet that will
    hold the funds in this case.

    ![Payouts](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/payouts.jpg)


    6. You can now set the rules for the token to be created. The token will
    have information such as reserved rate (the amount reserved when 1 ETH is
    contributed to the project), discount rate (the number of extra tokens
    contributors will receive in a funding cycle), redemption rate (the number
    of overflows each token can be redeemed for), token minting (whether or not
    the project owner can mint tokens to wallet addresses). A project can choose
    the default settings or customize its own settings to fit its goals.

    ![Token
    settings](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/token_settings.jpg)


    7. The next step is to create NFTs for the project. This step is optional
    and you can decide whether or not NFTs are relevant to your project or how
    they will be distributed to contributors or even what the utility will be
    for your project.

    ![Create
    NFTs](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/create_nfts.jpg)


    8. Projects can also choose the delay period before a funding cycle starts
    where changes are made to the token configuration. This delay will ensure
    that contributors know the changes that have been made before they are
    implemented on Juicebox. Again, this encourages trust among community
    members. The default on Juicebox is 3 days.

    Rules](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/reconfiguration_rules.jpg)


    9. Finally, the project owner can deploy the project on Goerli by signing
    the transaction with the required gas fee.

    Setting up your Juicebox project is quite simple and can be done in minutes
    if you have structured the rules that will govern the project as it relates
    to funding. You can also watch the video below to get a step-by-step view of
    how to set up your project on Juicebox.
