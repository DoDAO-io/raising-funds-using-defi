    Juicebox is a flexible programmable crypto funding protocol that can serve
    as a crypto-native replacement for platforms such as Kickstarter, Patreon,
    Gofundme, or even as an alternative to venture capital. Its fundamentals are
    straightforward:


    1. Supporters of your project receive tokens when they contribute. These
    tokens can be used for governance or accessing token-gated websites.

    2. You have the ability to distribute funds from your project to designated
    wallets or other Juicebox projects, with the flexibility to modify these
    distributions over time.

    3. If supporters are dissatisfied with the project's direction, they can
    redeem their tokens for a proportionate share of the Ethereum held in the
    project.

    As the project creator, you have significant control over these mechanisms.
    You can adjust token issuance rates, redemption rates, distributions, and
    other project settings, allowing for dynamic and effective tokenomics. 


    Additionally, you can lock in your settings for predetermined periods,
    demonstrating to the community that you will not take advantage of them.
    Juicebox provides you with the freedom to have as much control as you
    desire, while also allowing you to relinquish control when necessary.


    ### **Managing Funds**


    As the project creator, you have the ability to distribute funds to the
    wallets or projects of your choice, which you can change over time. If
    contributors are unhappy with the direction of the project, they can
    exchange their tokens for a proportional share of the ETH stored in the
    project. You have control over various mechanics such as token issuance
    rates, redemption rates, distributions, and other project details, giving
    you full flexibility in shaping the tokenomics of your project. These rules
    put in place build trust for communities and make it hard for projects to
    rug pull or try to scam people of their investments. Supporters and members
    of communities can easily believe in projects and what they want to achieve.


    ### **Building Trust**


    Additionally, you can lock in your settings for a set period, ensuring your
    community that you won't make any sudden changes. Juicebox offers you the
    choice to retain control or relinquish it when necessary. Built on Ethereum,
    Juicebox provides the platform for individuals to pay projects to either own
    their tokens or NFTs. As earlier mentioned, these tokens can be governance
    tokens of DAOs ie. being used to create proposals or vote on them depending
    on the voting structures that are in place within the DAO, they may also be
    a form of compensation for contributors or even a way to provide membership
    perks to community members. Every project has a unique way to use Juicebox
    depending on the peculiarity of the project.


    ### **Community Development**


    Finally, one of the key things to look out for in communities as they grow
    is if they are flexible to adapt to changes over time. This is why Juicebox
    lets projects adapt their rules and conditions as projects grow and members
    increase. Juicebox also integrates nicely with other tools such as Gnosis
    Safe, Snapshot, and other tools that various communities use to operate.
    With these in place, projects can rely on Juicebox for scalability.

  shortTitle: Setting Up
  details: >-
    Starting out on Juicebox is simply following a number of steps, the first is
    creating a project on Juicebox. To create a project on Juicebox, visit,
    [https://juicebox.money](https://juicebox.money) and click on ‘Create A
    Project’. In this course, we will be creating a project so you can follow
    the steps highlighted below. In this case, we will be using the Juicebox
    testnet on Goerli via
    [https://goerli.juicebox.money](https://goerli.juicebox.money) 


    1. Connect your wallet address on the Goerli network to get started.

    ![Available
    Wallets](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/available_wallets.jpg)


    2. Input the project details. These details are information such as the
    project name, project description, logo, project links, owner of the
    project, and customize pay button. Some of the fields are optional so you
    don’t have to fill them.

    ![Project
    Details](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/project_details.jpg)


    3. The next is to set the funding cycle for the project. On Juicebox, a
    funding cycle is a period where the settings are locked in before any change
    is made. This helps to build trust among contributors and community members
    knowing that for that period, no change to the rules of the token can be
    made. The default on Juicebox is 14 days if you select the automated funding
    cycle. Projects can however customize their funding cycles and put their own
    number of days if they choose the manual funding cycle.

    ![Funding
    Cycles](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/funding_cycles.jpg)


    4. Depending on the project, you can choose if the target for the funds
    being raised is specific where a portion of the funds is distributed to
    specific wallet addresses or an infinite target where the project holds all
    the funds.

    ![Funding
    Target](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/funding_target.jpg)


    5. The next step is to set the wallets that the payouts from the funds will
    be sent. This allows the project to allocate funds to various wallets in
    form of percentages or specific amounts (if the specific funding target was
    chosen). We will choose the project owner since that’s the wallet that will
    hold the funds in this case.

    ![Payouts](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/payouts.jpg)


    6. You can now set the rules for the token to be created. The token will
    have information such as reserved rate (the amount reserved when 1 ETH is
    contributed to the project), discount rate (the number of extra tokens
    contributors will receive in a funding cycle), redemption rate (the number
    of overflows each token can be redeemed for), token minting (whether or not
    the project owner can mint tokens to wallet addresses). A project can choose
    the default settings or customize its own settings to fit its goals.

    ![Token
    settings](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/token_settings.jpg)


    7. The next step is to create NFTs for the project. This step is optional
    and you can decide whether or not NFTs are relevant to your project or how
    they will be distributed to contributors or even what the utility will be
    for your project.

    ![Create
    NFTs](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/create_nfts.jpg)


    8. Projects can also choose the delay period before a funding cycle starts
    where changes are made to the token configuration. This delay will ensure
    that contributors know the changes that have been made before they are
    implemented on Juicebox. Again, this encourages trust among community
    members. The default on Juicebox is 3 days.

    Rules](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/reconfiguration_rules.jpg)


    9. Finally, the project owner can deploy the project on Goerli by signing
    the transaction with the required gas fee.

    ![Deploy to
    Goerli](https://d31h13bdjwgzxs.cloudfront.net/academy/dodao-academy-eth-1/Course/raising-funds-in-DeFi/juicebox/deploy_to%20goerli.jpg)


    Setting up your Juicebox project is quite simple and can be done in minutes
    if you have structured the rules that will govern the project as it relates
    to funding. You can also watch the video below to get a step-by-step view of
    how to set up your project on Juicebox.

- key: creating-nfts-as-payout-to-contributors
  shortTitle: Creating NFTs
  details: >-
    Juicebox allows project creators/owners to optionally reward their community
    members or contributors with NFTs by creating one or more custom NFT tiers.
    These NFTs can serve as tokens for governance within the projects whether
    off-chain on platforms such as Snapshot or on-chain on Tally. When creating
    projects, owners can set tiers from where a limited number of NFTs can be
    minted. They can also add or remove tiers as the project progresses. Each
    tier has a unique price, reserved rate, governance voting power, maximum
    supply, and unique metadata. Also, NFTs can be used for redemption instead
    of project tokens.


    In order to have NFTs, your project must have at least one tier. To
    establish a tier, select the "Add NFT" option. Every tier can possess:


    * An exclusive image, name, description, and link.

    * A minimum donation amount - the cost of your NFT. 

    * A limited quantity - the maximum number of NFTs that can be produced from
    this tier. You can utilize this to motivate early supporters. Each tier can
    have its own unique quantity.


    Some other functions that can be created when minting NFTs on Juicebox are
    **Reserve NFTs**


    Where contributors can be rewarded by giving them the opportunity to mint
    one NFT to any address of their choice when they earn an NFT. **Voting
    Weight** can also be created for each tier to allow for voting whether
    off-chain or on-chain within the DAO or project. Finally, you can create
    **External Links** to direct minters to the project’s website, Discord, or
    any place of their choice.


    To operate on-chain governance processes, Juicebox NFTs are deployed on the
    **ERC721Votes** standard To achieve this, Juicebox tracks an NFT’s ownership
    over time when they are minted, burned, traded, or transferred. Juicebox has
    three on-chain options when setting up NFTs, they include:


    * No on-chain governance: This means that the project won’t track voting
    power over time.

    * Standard on-chain governance: This tracks the total voting power of each
    address over time

    * Tier-based on-chain governance: As against tracking the total voting power
    of each address, this tracks the voting power on each address within an NFT
    tier. This is quite advanced as it is used for complex on-chain governance
    procedures.

  details: >-
    Creating a Juicebox project takes only 10 minutes, and it can help you in
    the following ways:


    - Raise ETH for your project through crowdfunding.

    - Generate Project Tokens and Project NFTs for your supporters, and reserve
    a portion of those tokens and NFTs for yourself, your team, or a community
    pool.

    - Establish trust with Cycles. These are predefined periods (e.g., 3
    minutes, 2 years, or 14 days) that allow you to lock your project's rules.

    When you modify your rules, the changes are queued for the next Cycle,
    instead of taking immediate effect.

    - Each cycle, pay out automated ETH compensations to your team. These
    payouts can be fixed ETH amounts, ETH amounts that adjust to USD values, or
    percentages of the total available ETH.

    - Enable your supporters to redeem their Project Tokens/NFTs for a portion
    of the ETH in your project. This can be a full or partial refund or can be
    turned off completely.

    - Set an Edit Deadline to prevent last-minute changes to your Cycle and
    prevent rug pulls. With a 3-day Edit Deadline, your community has three days
    to review any queued edits.


    When you create a Juicebox project, an Owner NFT is sent to your wallet,
    which is the only way to control the project. The project's rules are
    managed directly on the Ethereum blockchain, making your project transparent
    and immune to censorship.
