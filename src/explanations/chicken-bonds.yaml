    ### Introduction

    Chicken bond is a novel bonding mechanism, which allows protocols to deepen
    the protocol owned liquidity at no cost while boosting yield opportunities
    for their end users. 


    Bond purchasers can buy bonds using a token (e.g. TNK). When the bond is
    purchased, it has zero bTokens. bTokens are self-accruing tokens, so their
    value keeps increasing. At a certain time in the future, the bond purchaser
    breaks even on their investment, i.e. the `price of bToken * quantity =
    price of TKN * quantity invested in bond`. The bTokens accrued over and
    above this point is the user's profit.


    At any time, bond holders can either retrieve their principal foregoing the
    accrued amount (“chicken out”) or trade it in for the accrued bTKN (“chicken
    in”).



    The yield amplification is achieved by directing additional yield from
    Protocol owned liquidity and users bonding underlying tokens (TKN) to newly
    issued "boosted" tokens (bTKN).


    TKN acquired by the system backs the bTKN supply: while a portion of the TKN
    in the treasury is directly redeemable by bTKN holders, another portion
    contributes permanently to the redeemable value through its yield. Along
    with the yield retained from pending bonds, bTKN benefits from a rapidly
    rising price floor, making it an attractive investment.

    ## Buckets

    The protocol operates a Treasury that consists of three logical parts
    (“buckets”): Pending Bucket, Reserve Bucket and Permanent Bucket.


    #### Pending Bucket 

    The Pending Bucket contains the TKN that is still bonded by active users.
    This means that their deposits haven't been acquired by the protocol yet.
    Since bond holders may withdraw their bonded TKN at any time (chicken out),
    their deposits are considered as pending. The yield earned by the Pending
    Bucket is credited to the Reserve Bucket.


    #### Reserve Bucket

    This graph contains data on the total amount of TKN that was relinquished by
    former bond holders after a "chicken in" event, as well as the yield of the
    Pending and Permanent buckets. The Reserve bucket directly backs the bTokens
    supply through the redemption mechanism.


    #### Permanent Bucket

    Contains the other portion of the TKN relinquished by former bond holders.
    The yield earned by the Permanent Bucket is credited to the Reserve Bucket.


    Having a Permanent Bucket can turn out as unnecessary or even detrimental
    for some use cases.

    As an alternative, the protocol can thus be set up without a Permanent
    Bucket



    ## Yield Amplification (bToken)

    The Reserve Bucket not only earns a return on its own assets, but
    additionally receives

    the returns from the Pending and the Permanent Buckets, achieving an
    amplified return.  This useful property is called yield amplification.


    As the protocol doesn’t distribute any yields, but reinvests them inside the
    Reserve Bucket, the

    value of the Reserve Bucket grows over time even without the inflow of new
    capital. Due to the

    yield amplification, the Reserve Bucket grows faster than if the same funds
    were invested regularly

    with a (compounding) rate of return.


    ## Flow

    First, when a user bonds their tokens, the tokens are sent to the Pending
    bucket. Then, depending on whether the user chickens in, the "chickened-in"
    funds are sent to the other two buckets, Reserve and Permanent.


    The tokens in the Reserve bucket are directly responsible for the backing of
    the generated bTokens, while the tokens in the Permanent bucket are
    permanently owned by the system and are used to generate yield to be
    funneled into the Reserve bucket. 


    ## Economics

    The Boosted Token bTokens derives its value from the Reserve Bucket, as its
    direct backing, and the yield generated by the entire Treasury.


    Since the bTokens supply is redeemable for a proportional share of the
    acquired TKN, the market cap of bTokens should normally be worth at least
    the amount of TKN kept in the Reserve Bucket. This means that the redemption
    price pr will act as a price floor, below which arbitrage becomes possible.


    This system is designed to protect investors by ensuring that the bToken
    always has a minimum value.

    The Chicken Bond protocol is a way for projects to get Protocol Owned
    Liquidity without having to pay for it outright. 


    The way it works is by creating a 'flywheel effect' between bonding and
    bToken pricing. In other words, the more people bond, the more yield is
    retained for bToken holders. 


    If someone decides to chicken out and leave the system, the yield they would
    have earned from their TKN goes into the Reserve bucket. This increases
    rewards for others who stay in the system, and incentivizes them to continue
    participating.


    A higher yield makes bonding more attractive, because it increases the price
    premium over the underlying TKN. This provides the protocol with both
    permanent and redeemable TKN liquidity, which can be used for different
    needs based on the needs of the project.


    ### Downsides

    - Though chicken bonds are a great instrument financially, it can be a bit
    overwhelming for new users

    - The system is dynamic, that means that there can be instances when, people
    who bond early get less rewards than those who join later.
