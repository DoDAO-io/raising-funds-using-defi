    ### Introduction

    Chicken bond is a novel bonding mechanism, which allows protocols to deepen
    the protocol owned liquidity at no cost while boosting yield opportunities
    for their end users. 


    Bond purchasers can buy bonds using a token (e.g. TNK). When the bond is
    purchased, it has zero bTokens. bTokens are self-accruing tokens, so their
    value keeps increasing. At a certain time in the future, the bond purchaser
    breaks even on their investment, i.e. the `price of bToken * quantity =
    price of TKN * quantity invested in bond`. The bTokens accrued over and
    above this point is the user's profit.


    At any time, bond holders can either retrieve their principal foregoing the
    accrued amount (“chicken out”) or trade it in for the accrued bTKN (“chicken
    in”).



    The yield amplification is achieved by directing additional yield from
    Protocol owned liquidity and users bonding underlying tokens (TKN) to newly
    issued "boosted" tokens (bTKN).


    TKN acquired by the system backs the bTKN supply: while a portion of the TKN
    in the treasury is directly redeemable by bTKN holders, another portion
    contributes permanently to the redeemable value through its yield. Along
    with the yield retained from pending bonds, bTKN benefits from a rapidly
    rising price floor, making it an attractive investment.

    ## Buckets

    The protocol operates a Treasury that consists of three logical parts
    (“buckets”): Pending Bucket, Reserve Bucket and Permanent Bucket.


    #### Pending Bucket 

    The Pending Bucket contains the TKN that is still bonded by active users.
    This means that their deposits haven't been acquired by the protocol yet.
    Since bond holders may withdraw their bonded TKN at any time (chicken out),
    their deposits are considered as pending. The yield earned by the Pending
    Bucket is credited to the Reserve Bucket.


    #### Reserve Bucket

    This graph contains data on the total amount of TKN that was relinquished by
    former bond holders after a "chicken in" event, as well as the yield of the
    Pending and Permanent buckets. The Reserve bucket directly backs the bTokens
    supply through the redemption mechanism.


    #### Permanent Bucket

    Contains the other portion of the TKN relinquished by former bond holders.
    The yield earned by the Permanent Bucket is credited to the Reserve Bucket.


    Having a Permanent Bucket can turn out as unnecessary or even detrimental
    for some use cases.

    As an alternative, the protocol can thus be set up without a Permanent
    Bucket




    ## Investing

    It is understood that the user bonds the protocol tokens in return for a
    virtual accrual of bTokens which the user can choose to claim (Chicken-in)
    or not (Chicken-out). But the question of how the bTokens provide more yield
    than the underlying tokens and how it is feasible for the protocol arises.
    To answer that, we need to understand where the bonded underlying tokens go.
    But first let us have a brief overview of the bonding itself.


    Users can benefit from the system by,

    * **Bonding:** The user can make a profit by bonding, achieving breakeven
    and then redeeming the bTokens


    * **Investing:** Buy the bTokens on the market as a long-term investment
    with amplified returns and limited downside risks.

    * **Sell the bond:** Sell the chicken-bond NFTs in NFT market places.




    At any point in time, the holder of the bond can decide to:

    * **Claim bond (Chicken In):** claim and mint the accrued balance of bTokens
    in exchange for the deposited tokens.

    * **Cancel bond (Chicken Out):** retrieve the deposited tokens (principal)
    forgoing the accrued balance of bTokens.

    * **Users can sell their bonds:** Represented as NFTs on the secondary
    market like OpenSea. This especially makes sense for bonds that have accrued
    a significant amount of bTokens without breaking even yet.

    Now that we have that clear,  let us see where the bonded tokens go and how
    it aids in the bTokens achieving a boosted yield.


    **Flow**


    First, when a user bonds their tokens, the tokens are sent to the Pending
    bucket. Then, depending on whether the user chickens in, the “chickened-in”
    funds are sent to the other two buckets, Reserve and Permanent.


    The tokens in the Reserve bucket are directly responsible for the backing of
    the generated bTokens, while the tokens in the Permanent bucket are
    permanently owned by the system and are used to generate yield to be
    funneled into the Reserve bucket. 


    **Boosted yield**


    **Backing ratio never decreases**


    Whenever somebody Chickens In, the protocol expands the bToken supply in the
    same proportion as it increases the Reserve Bucket backing them. Let us see
    how.  The protocol makes sure that the backing ratio, given by ``tokens in
    reserve bucket / boosted token supply`` never decreases. This means that
    whenever there is a chicken-in event and bTokens are minted, the amount of
    underlying tokens sent to the reserve will be such that the backing ratio
    never decreases (or remains the same as it was before the chicken-in
    event). 


    This is done by levying a maximum cap (as we saw on the graph) on the amount
    of bTokens generated according to the current backing rate. The cap is
    defined as ``boosted_token_supply/reserve_bucket ``. 


    To better understand, let us consider an example  For instance, let’s assume
    a user bonds 120 TKN, and the current backing ratio is 1.5. Therefore the
    cap for that bond would be 80 bTKN (= 120 / 1.5). After some time and
    reaching **80%** of the cap the user claims the bond. So the system mints 64
    bTKN for the user, and the bonded amount is split in 96 TKN **(80%)** which
    go to the Reserve Bucket, and 24 TKN (the remaining 20%) which are deposited
    in the Permanent bucket.


    **Boosted yield and rising price floor**


    On top of the yield token always being backed at a set minimum ratio per
    each chicken-in event, the Reserve bucket is constantly accruing yield from
    the other two buckets which means that the backing ratio keeps increasing as
    time passes. For example, say at some time T, we had a backing ratio 1.5, at
    some time T+X we would have a higher backing ratio, say 2. Because the
    backing ratio never decreases per chicken-in event and on top of that, the
    amount of underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket keeps increasing owing to
    yield from the tokens in the other two buckets. 


    Remember, bTokens can be redeemed for a pro-rata ratio of the Reserve
    bucket. Since the number of underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket
    increases faster than the total number of bTokens according to the above
    logic, a scenario where the price floor for the bTokens keeps increasing is
    created (Meaning the amount of underlying tokens redeemable for the given
    amount of bTokens keeps increasing, theoretically). 


    **Summary and the flywheel effect**


    To sum up, Given that the yield from all three buckets is sent to the
    Reserve Bucket, the backing ratio (price floor) will grow faster than the
    value of a simple portfolio of the underlying token. By pricing in the
    amplified growth, the bTokens should trade at a premium against their price
    floor, driving a flywheel: the more people bond, the more yield is retained
    for the bToken holders. A higher yield in turn increases the price premium,
    making bonding more attractive through a higher APR.


    To ensure that bonding remains attractive when the premium drops, the
    protocol may automatically adjust the accrual rate (steepness of the accrual
    curve) using a controller targeting an average Chicken In time or bond age.

    ### The advantages


    Contrasting chicken bonds with another way which protocols use to deepen
    liquidity of their token, staking. We have seen that in staking, protocols
    initially offer a very high APR to attract users to deposit tokens in their
    reserves and thus deepen their Protocol Owned Liquidity which can help the
    protocol in gaining stability for their token, and credibility in the
    market. But these high APRs are often unsustainable and as soon as the
    protocol starts offering a more practical APR on staking, the users start
    pulling out their funds since they no longer find this to be a profitable
    investment. In this system we see that the protocol cannot reward users for
    their prolonged participation, as the APR is likely to decrease in the long
    run. 

    On the other hand, chicken bonds help protocols deepen their liquidity by
    providing a novel bonding mechanism which rewards users for their long term
    participation while simultaneously deepening their Protocol Owned Liquidity.
    Ofcourse, on the user side of things there is always the issue of volatility
    of the bToken or the underlying token in DEXs which could mean that user
    incurs a loss but in theory, the user can yield more with the bToken than
    they would with the underlying token which is an attractive offer for the
    users holding the underlying token, who are the target users for this
    mechanism. 
     
    Helps deepen the liquidity of the protocol, and to hold a soft peg. 

    The bond has no maturity, meaning the user can choose to reap the benefits
    or quit if they do not find it to be profitable at anytime, which is often
    not possible in staking. This makes chicken bonds more attractive to users.

    The user can obtain dynamic NFTs whose rarity can vary depending on the time
    that has passed since chickening in, etc. These NFTs are proof of ownership
    of the bonds, meaning that the bonds can be sold and bought in markets,
    opening new investment opportunities.

    Other options of generating liquidity often involve recurring expenses from
    the protocol, which is unsustainable unless there is a lot of funding for
    the protocol. But in the case of chicken bonds, all the protocol needs to
    capture liquidity is time, and ofcourse users to bond, the users will start
    using chicken bonds when they realize that it is worthwhile.


    An example of the advantage of bTokens with the use of bLUSD. Say LUSD is
    trading at a price premium to its $1 peg, as long as LUSD is trading above
    its peg, users will mint LUSD and try to take advantage of arbitrage. With
    bLUSD, users can get compounded yield on LUSD which makes the arbitrage
    option more attractive. This way, as long as there is a price premium for
    LUSD, users will be more incentivized to invest it in chicken bonds and reap
    more benefits. While simultaneously, the LUSD liquidity will be deepened,
    making it stabler and helping to reduce the price premium, which is what is
    expected of a stablecoin (to trade at peg value).

    ### Drawbacks using LUSD/bLUSD as an example


    Like with all protocols, the b.protocol (chicken-bonds) also has its own
    downsides. Let us look at a few of them with the help of Liquity as an
    example.


    Sometimes, it could be more profitable to chicken out and simply buy bLUSD
    in an exchange than to accrue it from being bonded. Also, the idea of
    rebonding (redeeming bToken from a previous bond to bond again with a larger
    amount of underlying token) can sometimes prove to be too time taking and
    providing very little yield in the end whereas the user can just buy bLUSD
    and become an LP for a better yield (a user would rebond only when the bLUSD
    value has achieved breakeven with the LUSD invested, which can take a long
    time sometimes). Though as people chicken out to buy bLUSD, the rebond time
    to make a profitable chicken-in decreases, but the user can chicken out and
    not buy bLUSD at all, users might face loss in such a scenario.



    bLUSD is often trading at a premium, if user buys bLUSD to become LP in a
    curve pool, it is very likely that the user will not be able to cover the
    premium that they paid using the APY being offered by being an LP. Also, it
    is interesting to note that as users chicken-out, the APY for bLUSD supply
    decreases. In the first scenario, the only other option for the user to make
    any progress with bLUSD being buying it in an exchange and becoming LP is
    again not solid, since the APY for the bLUSD supply will decrease and the
    bLUSD premium will be too much for the reducing APY to cover. In other
    words, if the rebonding proves to be not profitable, or time taking, the
    user might want to become bLUSD LP, but that option is also not great since
    the bLUSD price and the APY it earns are not at par with each other (you
    would want more APY than the bLUSD premium price).
