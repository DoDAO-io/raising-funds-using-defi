    ### What is Fjord Foundry?
        

    Fjord Foundry is a community platform that connects project teams with
    passionate supporters via Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBP's). It empowers
    project teams to generate liquidity directly through community
    participation. The creators of Fjord Foundry believe in a world where
    decentralized, permissionless engagement creates the ideal conditions for
    bold ideas to thrive and gives individuals and communities the power to
    shape the future they want to see.


    Fjord Foundry specializes in Fair Launch Auctions (FLAs) - a crowdfunding
    mechanism that enables projects and ideas from around the world to raise
    money from individuals without any barriers to entry. The platform is
    designed to make it easy for users to create and use Liquidity Bootstrapping
    Pools (LBPs) through its intuitive and user-friendly website. The main
    concept of Fjord Foundry is to allow for the distribution of tokens and NFTs
    with a transparent, open, and fair price discovery mechanism. The platform
    has a long-standing reputation in the industry, which has led to an
    [exclusive collaboration
    agreement](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xcc065f373e15a264e1647bc794a4a83039fc4d377a69875ec828eb0148faa4ba)
    between the Balancer DAO and Fjord Foundry. This agreement allows Fjord
    Foundry to offer the most cutting-edge and efficient LBP technology to its
    users.


    #### Why Choose Fjord?


    Fjord Foundry is a community platform that offers several advantages over
    other platforms. 


    - **Sniper Bots**  One of the key advantages of Fjord Foundry is its
    resistance to sniper bots. On other platforms, the token or NFT launch
    process is often gamed by experienced developers who use bots specifically
    designed to detect when a new token or NFT is listed, allowing them to scoop
    up all of the supply before anyone else even has a chance. However, Fjord
    Foundry has implemented a built-in high-low price discovery mechanism, which
    makes it resistant to sniper bots. This allows users to join in whenever
    they feel the price is fair.

    - **Providing Equal Opportunity**  Another advantage of Fjord Foundry is its
    provision of equal opportunity. On Fjord Foundry, whales, VCs, and other
    large players are unable to game the start of liquidity bootstrapping pools
    (LBPs), which means the average person is given the opportunity to
    participate in these opportunities without worrying about asymmetric
    information that can affect launch events. The platform provides open and
    transparent token and NFT LBPs, with all the information users need right in
    front of them.

    - **Sustainable Communities**  Fjord Foundry also promotes sustainable
    communities by deterring sniper bots and allowing communities equal
    opportunity to participate in token and NFT launch events. This fosters a
    sense of trust and ownership among community members, which can encourage
    greater community involvement and more engaged communities over the long
    term.

    - **Price Discovery**  Fjord Foundry's LBP's allow for price discovery, as
    the price of the token starts high and drops over time based on a
    pre-configured price decay curve. This can be resisted by buying pressure
    from participants, and anyone can buy into or sell out of the LBP freely at
    any time, so the price truly regulates itself.

    - **Proven Track Record**  Fjord Foundry has a proven track record of
    hosting the highest volume and enabling teams to bootstrap the highest
    amount when compared to other comparable platforms, by a significant margin.
    The platform encourages wider community participation, and users do not need
    to rely on traditional funding methods to build their ideas.

    ### What is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool?


    A Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) is a specific configuration of
    [Balancer's Liquidity
    Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps).
    LBPs are primarily used to distribute digital tokens using a fair, open, and
    transparent price discovery mechanism.


    Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) are just smart pools that can change
    token weighting dynamically (for example, 1/99 to 99/1 for TokenA/TokenB).
    [Weighted Math](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/weighted-math) along
    with time-dependent weights is used by LBPs. The pool owner, who also has
    the ability to pause exchanges, chooses the starting and ending weights and
    timings.


    Consider the beginning price of your LBP to be the ceiling you wish to set
    for the token sale. This may appear contradictory, but because LBPs operate
    differently than other token sales, your starting price should be
    significantly higher than what you believe to be the reasonable price. This
    does not imply that you are attempting to sell the token for more than it is
    worth. Setting a high initial price allows the changing pool weights of your
    LBP to fully effect the price, gradually dropping it until market
    equilibrium is established. Unlike previous token sale methods, such as
    bonding curves, consumers are disincentivized to buy early and instead gain
    from waiting for the price to fall until it hits a level they consider fair.


    Below image gives nice visualization of how the price discovery curve varies
    with start and end weights.


    But having said that, price does not always keep decreasing as it not only
    depends on the weights but also takes the demand into consideration. Thus
    the price can also increase if there is an increased demand.

    #### Key Features


    * **Price discovery** - One of the key features of LBPs is the mechanism of
    price discovery. The price of the token starts high and drops based on a
    pre-configured price decay curve. This process can be resisted by buying
    pressure from LBP participants, and anyone can buy into or sell out of the
    LBP freely at any time, so the price truly regulates itself.


    * **Permissionless participation** - Another feature of LBPs is open and
    permissionless participation. Unlike other platforms, LBPs do not require
    whitelists, hard caps, or listing requirements. There is no minimum or
    maximum allocation and LBP participants are free to choose how much they
    want to buy.


    * **Fair distribution** - LBPs also promote fair distribution of tokens,
    flipping the first-come-first-serve launch model on its head. This ensures
    that it's no longer a race where the first bot in or the transaction with
    the highest gas fee wins. It allows for getting tokens into the hands of as
    many people as possible in a fair way that disincentives front-runners and
    whales from getting better rates than smaller participants.


    * **Capital efficiency** - Lastly, LBPs provide capital efficiency, as The
    initial value of the project's token in LBP can be multiplied by up to 99
    times in relation to the collateral put with it. Furthermore, unless the
    project's tokens already exist outside of the LBP, the collateral can be
    fully reclaimed at the end of the LBP, in which case someone may choose to
    sell into the LBP.

    ### How does Fjord support token divestments via LBPs?


    Fjord can support sustainable token divestment of token assets for projects
    and DAOs that hold the tokens of another project in their treasury via a
    partnership or agreement. It is common for there to be donations made of
    tokens to a particular charity or group or a need to generate liquidity for
    tokens held in the treasury. However, it can be challenging to divest these
    tokens without harming the market and/or community for that token.
    Additionally, it can be time-consuming to constantly undertake this process.


    Many projects have given large portions of tokens to well-known groups and
    figureheads. For example, Vitalik Buterin received trillions of Shiba Inu
    tokens while Gitcoin also received trillions of Akita Inu tokens via Vitalik
    ($5 million USD in value). The Gitcoin community was left with the question
    of what was the most efficient, fair, and appropriate way to maximize the
    sale value of the tokens while not causing an immediate and negative impact
    to the token price and the AKITA community.


    The answer for Gitcoin was a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping (LBP) Pool
    created and hosted by Fjord Foundry. The price decay mechanics of an LBP
    allow for true price discovery, and for price decay to occur via weighted
    pools over a time duration that can be customized to the LBP owner's
    choosing. In the instance of Gitcoin, the LBP was scheduled over a period of
    365 days, ensuring a supply shock did not instantly crash the price of the
    token.


    Additionally, the Fjord platform allows for both buying and selling of
    AKITA, so the price is able to generally keep equilibrium with the current
    market price available on alternative exchanges, with some savvy traders
    able to take quick advantage of any arbitrage opportunities that may arise
    from any price discrepancies. Due to the slow price decay over a long time
    horizon and the arbitrage opportunity, the main token of the LBP, in this
    case AKITA, is slowly absorbed by the overall crypto market in exchange for
    WETH without a drastic impact to AKITA price.

  title: What are Redemption Pools?
  shortTitle: Redemption Pools
  details: >
    ### What are Redemption Pools?


    These are special pools that allow projects to progressively distribute a
    token over a defined time period in exchange for a specified base token (In
    some cases this could be releasing a governance token in exchange for LP).
    During the Redemption Pool period, users can exchange the base token for the
    project's token, which contributes to the collective decision of the asset's
    fair value.


    Previously, only particular base tokens (USDC, DAI, ETH, WETH) were
    available as assets for projects to accumulate via standard [Liquidity
    Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) on
    Fjord](https://help.fjordfoundry.com/fjord-foundry-docs/welcome-info/welcome-to-fjord-foundry),
    however redemption pools let any asset to be designated for that role. 


    #### Protocol Owned Liquidity via Redemption Pools


    A protocol may desire to acquire POL from an audience that is optimistic on
    the protocol and wants to be more involved in it (among other things) in
    exchange for a reduced governance token. The protocol can set up a
    Redemption Pool on Fjord, which not only allows for the above distribution
    but also allows protocol members to collectively choose the discount of the
    governance token compared to the liquidity they provide to the protocol.


    This form of governance token distribution allows the project to
    progressively distribute their token while acquiring more control over their
    liquidity.Furthermore, the extended time horizon for token distribution, as
    opposed to distributing over a condensed time period, allows a project to
    reduce point in time risk and provides greater flexibility to adjust the
    governance token distribution rate.


    Redemption Pools can also be carried out in a sequential manner based on the
    needs of the project and do not have to be a single event. Sequentially
    launching Redemption Pools allows teams to tune the pool's weights and other
    factors as needed to support the continuing distribution of their token
    while also ensuring the discount rate falls within the intended target.


    #### Token Buybacks via Redemption Pools


    Token buybacks via redemption pools can be a powerful tool for decentralized
    autonomous organizations (DAOs) and projects to support the price of their
    native token during volatile market conditions. Redemption pools allow for
    efficient buybacks by providing a mechanism for the treasury to purchase its
    own tokens with reduced volatility, while also maximizing the number of
    tokens that are returned to the treasury.


    When undertaking token buybacks via traditional automated market maker (AMM)
    models, treasuries may not be realizing the full potential of their buyback
    efforts. They may need to buy their token at a higher price, which can lead
    to a short-term spike in the token's value. However, this also means that
    fewer tokens are returned to the treasury, which can have a negative
    long-term impact on the price of the token. As a result, the overall impact
    of the buyback may not be as effective as it could have been, with less
    value accrued by the treasury in terms of quantity of tokens.


    Conversely, undertaking a treasury buyback via Fjord's weighted liquidity
    pools allows projects to accumulate governance tokens back to the treasury
    in a slow and steady manner. The use of weighted pools enables a reduced
    market impact, leading to a higher accrual of tokens, less tokens on the
    market, and an improved composition of the treasury. This approach can help
    to ensure that token buybacks are effective in supporting the price of the
    token over the long term, by taking a more sustainable approach to removing
    tokens from circulation.
