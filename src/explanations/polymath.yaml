    Polymath is an asset tokenization platform that enables people to digitize
    real-world assets and can mint tokens backing the assets for the purpose of
    getting investors or generally raising funds for projects. It is built as an
    open-source tool operated on smart contracts where anyone can access it and
    build on its infrastructure to create new solutions. As a security token,
    Polymenth is powered by ERC1400 which is the standard for regulated assets
    living on the Blockchain. This way investors can be whitelisted, Know Your
    Customer (KYC) processes can be initiated easily to know who owns what,
    limits on transitions can be set, and so on.


    Polymath is built on the Polymesh blockchain which is a specific protocol
    built for handling security tokens. It is able to manage certain functions
    such as compliance, identity, confidentiality, and governance which other
    blockchains may not be able to cover in full. Polymesh is operated on the
    ERC 1400 (an Ethereum-based standard for security tokens). 


    Since 2017, Polymath has continuously strived to work with the Blockchain
    ecosystem to come up with a system that works for all. With the advanced
    technology that has been built by Polymath, issuers can automate their flows
    and state the rules about who can access or hold their tokens, what
    locations the tokens can be accessed from, how they can be transferred, the
    requirements for holding the tokens, etc. It is also highly customizable as
    you can create your offer, set up your yield strategy, issue tokens, manage
    your team of experts, attract investors to your business, manage current and
    future portfolios, and access to key players in the ecosystem while
    positioning your business for massive growth.


    As a major player in the industry, Polymath has developed products that will
    cater to the needs of anyone who wants to build solutions that will digitize
    their real-world assets. With use cases such as effective asset onboarding,
    compliance assurance, transfer restrictions, redundant data, source insight,
    transfer disable functions, asset recovery, and identity verification, and
    with a deeply technical team focused on making the process simpler and
    easier, Polymath is powering the future of security tokens

    Polymesh is the purpose-built blockchain network built by the Polymath team
    to manage security tokens. At the advent of Polymath, smart contracts were
    launched on a general blockchain, Ethereum, to build a token that will
    digitize physical assets. These tokens would serve as security tokens such
    that people who own physical assets in real life, can have a digital token
    to prove ownership of such assets. These tokens can then be traded in the
    primary and secondary markets thereby transferring ownership of not just the
    token but also the assets. 


    However, there are many challenges surrounding the ERC20 protocol that was
    to be used that would make it not suitable for security tokens. Some of
    those challenges include anonymity since people can trade tokens without
    necessarily verifying their identities so this could easily create a
    loophole for theft. Also, these assets sit on regulated markets but the core
    ERC20 protocol was built for an unregulated environment so there is almost
    no way to enforce compliance with procedures and basic requirements for
    trading securities on the Blockchain.


    These and many more issues created an opportunity for a new protocol and a
    new network, hence Polymath going ahead to build the Polymesh network
    specifically for security tokens, backed by the ERC 1400 protocol which was
    also created for securities. Polymesh, therefore, was built on the parity
    substrate framework because of its novel technology, product roadmap and fit
    with what Ploymath is building, community and a number of other factors some
    of which include:


    * Modularity: Polymath operates a modular structure as a part of its
    infrastructure where new rules and features can be added to the network
    easily by creating new modules while maintaining an interoperable library of
    the ERC 1400 protocol where people can use only parts of the protocol that
    makes sense to them. Substrate also operates a similar model thereby making
    a seamless integration possible. It has a library of modules for functions
    such as finality, block production, balance management, governance features,
    and support for smart contracts.

    * Future-Proof Technology: The major parts of the Substrate infrastructure
    are built on Rust; a language known for high performance, low runtime size,
    and optimized for memory safety guarantees. It is also built on industry
    standards such as LibP2P and WASM which are slowly being adopted by other
    Blockchains like Ethereum.

    * Governance and Upgrades: Polymesh being a blockchain built for a specific
    purpose, needed to run on a framework that gives it the flexibility it
    needed to provide all necessary requirements. Substrate provides a forkless
    upgrade mechanism such that the process of upgrading the software is done
    seamlessly. 

    * Community: Polymath has a large number of people building various
    solutions on their infrastructure and Substrate also has a great community
    of developers that make the work seamless. So, there is a symbiotic
    relationship between the two as Ploymesh can easily leverage the Substrate
    community when releasing features or marketing their products.

    The Polymath Capital Platform is an all-inclusive platform built on the
    Polymesh blockchain to power the process of raising funds for real-world
    projects or getting investments on a real-world asset by providing security
    tokens to people who invest in these assets or projects. It is designed to
    work for everyone, whether you are an investment advisor, an investor, or an
    asset owner. It is one of the most robust systems to provide this service to
    people. What makes this really interesting is that it is operated on the
    Blockchain which is a transparent and decentralized network for anyone to be
    a part of.


    Asset owners can easily create and issue tokens, create a yield amount for
    investments made, create a capitalization table to know what all investors
    own, apply KYC/KYB restrictions where necessary, and get team members
    onboarded on the Ploymath Capital Platform. Investors can as well get
    invited to invest or be able to browse through various investments to know
    which fit them based on the jurisdiction, yield, KYC, and any other
    constraint that might be placed on investment while advisors can generally
    have access to information if the team has that function from the get-go.
    They can have information on cap tables, tokens created, and any other
    documentation or process created in the team.


    As an end-to-end platform, Polymath provides not just tools for fundraising
    but for investor management throughout the lifecycle of the investment.
    Everything needed to manage the process is already included in the software.
    Some of the core features highlighted are:


    * Cap Table Management

    * Corporate Governance

    * Onboarding

    * Investorsâ€™ Accreditation

    * Custody

    * Investment Offerings


    Building for regulated markets definitely has a lot of challenges and this
    is why Polymath is committed to making the process of securitizing physical
    assets via tokens operated on the blockchain seamless.

    The Polymath token studio is the platform where issuers can create security
    tokens either on the Polymesh network or on Ethereum. The process of
    creating these tokens starts with reservation, which is a 60-day period
    where a security token ticker symbol can be locked before opening it up to
    the public. For example, if GMT is a ticker symbol that is available on
    Polymesh, an issuer can reserve GMT for a period of 60 days within which the
    token must be created and if after that period the token is not created,
    then GMT is made available for the public to use. Reserving a token on
    Polymath costs 500 POLYX.


    Before the minting process can begin, the issuer needs to firstly assemble
    the team that will provide the base requirements for the token to be
    created. This team can be a combination of Legal Firms, Deal Brokers, KYC
    providers, and a network of custody agents among others.


    Once the issuer is ready to mint the security token, 2500 POLYX is required
    to sign the transaction so that the token will go live. After that process
    is completed then the compliance rules of the token can be set so that
    people who will own the token will be bound by those rules. The last process
    is then to distribute the token.


    When Polymath was first launched on Ethereum, it created the POLY token
    which is an ERC20 token. However, when it moved to Polymesh which is its own
    Blockchain network, it changed its token to POLYX. Issuers who owned POLY
    and wish to change them to POLYX so as to use the Polymesh blockchain can do
    so by following the steps in the video below:

    Also, Polymath supports the minting of security tokens that operate on the
    Ethereum Blockchain to enable people who want to use a general-purpose
    blockchain network. To set this up, watch the video below:
