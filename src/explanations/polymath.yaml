    Polymath is an asset tokenization platform that enables people to digitize
    real-world assets and can mint tokens backing the assets for the purpose of
    getting investors or generally raising funds for projects. It is built as an
    open-source tool operated on smart contracts where anyone can access it and
    build on its infrastructure to create new solutions. As a security token,
    Polymenth is powered by ERC1400 which is the standard for regulated assets
    living on the Blockchain. This way investors can be whitelisted, Know Your
    Customer (KYC) processes can be initiated easily to know who owns what,
    limits on transitions can be set, and so on.


    Polymath is built on the Polymesh blockchain which is a specific protocol
    built for handling security tokens. It is able to manage certain functions
    such as compliance, identity, confidentiality, and governance which other
    blockchains may not be able to cover in full. Polymesh is operated on the
    ERC 1400 (an Ethereum-based standard for security tokens). 


    Since 2017, Polymath has continuously strived to work with the Blockchain
    ecosystem to come up with a system that works for all. With the advanced
    technology that has been built by Polymath, issuers can automate their flows
    and state the rules about who can access or hold their tokens, what
    locations the tokens can be accessed from, how they can be transferred, the
    requirements for holding the tokens, etc. It is also highly customizable as
    you can create your offer, set up your yield strategy, issue tokens, manage
    your team of experts, attract investors to your business, manage current and
    future portfolios, and access to key players in the ecosystem while
    positioning your business for massive growth.


    As a major player in the industry, Polymath has developed products that will
    cater to the needs of anyone who wants to build solutions that will digitize
    their real-world assets. With use cases such as effective asset onboarding,
    compliance assurance, transfer restrictions, redundant data, source insight,
    transfer disable functions, asset recovery, and identity verification, and
    with a deeply technical team focused on making the process simpler and
    easier, Polymath is powering the future of security tokens
