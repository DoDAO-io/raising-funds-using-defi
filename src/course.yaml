  Traditional businesses or startups tend to follow one of several growth-based
  blueprints as they progress through different stages, such as pre-seed, seed,
  Series A, Series B, and Series C/D/IPO. Many of these companies eventually
  outgrow their original objectives and begin to pursue a purely financial
  route, focusing solely on metrics such as revenue, profits, and growth.


  In how many startups do we see

  - Funds being raised from the community

  - Profits being shared with the community

  - Important decisions taken collectively by employees and customers

  - Sharing profits with customers

  - Having customers as investors

  - Longer term members being compensated more than short term members

  - All the employees as share holders with sizeable share percentages


  DeFi makes it possible for anyone to invest in a project. Early investors who
  take on more risk can potentially receive greater rewards. Additionally,
  unlike traditional VC models, investors are not locked into multi-year fund
  cycles. They can invest and then resell their tokens whenever they want. 


  We will see many new ways that projects can raise money through DeFi or by
  using DeFi techniques. This will provide more opportunities for people to get
  involved in projects and potentially receive greater rewards for their
  investment.

      In this chapter we will explore the different models that various projects
      can use to raise capital. Each model has different use cases. Some of
      these are for raising the initial funds, some for public good projects,
      some for research-based projects, and a few for acquiring liquidity in
      DeFi projects. 


      By understanding the different options available to you, you can choose
      the best model for your project and ensure that you have a solid plan for
      raising the necessary funds.

      Bond Protocol was born out of OIP-104 on July 15th, 2022 following the
      success of Olympus Pro (OP), enabling it to establish a standalone entity.
      It aims to be a credibly neutral platform, laser-focused on providing
      Bonds-as-a-Service to meet the needs of DeFi with innovative ideas.

      Liquidity mining comes with a few drawbacks - the main one being that even
      after receiving rewards, liquidity providers still have 100% control over
      their liquidity and can choose to pull out of the protocol at any time. In
      fact, past patterns show that most of the liquidity providers do leave the
      protocol within a couple of days after the rewards are reduced or stopped.


      Bonds offer a great alternative for protocols that want to own 100% of
      their liquidity. This chapter discusses Chicken Bonds, which is one
      implementation of "DeFi Bonds."
