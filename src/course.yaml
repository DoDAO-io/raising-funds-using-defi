  Traditional businesses or startups tend to follow one of several growth-based
  blueprints as they progress through different stages, such as pre-seed, seed,
  Series A, Series B, and Series C/D/IPO. Many of these companies eventually
  outgrow their original objectives and begin to pursue a purely financial
  route, focusing solely on metrics such as revenue, profits, and growth.


  In how many startups do we see

  - Funds being raised from the community

  - Profits being shared with the community

  - Important decisions taken collectively by employees and customers

  - Sharing profits with customers

  - Having customers as investors

  - Longer term members being compensated more than short term members

  - All the employees as share holders with sizeable share percentages


  DeFi makes it possible for anyone to invest in a project. Early investors who
  take on more risk can potentially receive greater rewards. Additionally,
  unlike traditional VC models, investors are not locked into multi-year fund
  cycles. They can invest and then resell their tokens whenever they want. 


  We will see many new ways that projects can raise money through DeFi or by
  using DeFi techniques. This will provide more opportunities for people to get
  involved in projects and potentially receive greater rewards for their
  investment.
