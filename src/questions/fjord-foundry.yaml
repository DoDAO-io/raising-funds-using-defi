  content: How should the starting price of an LBP be set in comparison to what is believed to be the reasonable price?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Consider the beginning price of your LBP to be the ceiling you wish to set for the token sale. This may appear contradictory, but because LBPs operate differently than other token sales, your starting price should be significantly higher than what you believe to be the reasonable price. This does not imply that you are attempting to sell the token for more than it is worth.

  content: What is the goal of setting a high initial price in a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Setting a high initial price allows the changing pool weights of your LBP to fully effect the price, gradually dropping it until market equilibrium is established. Unlike previous token sale methods, such as bonding curves, consumers are disincentivized to buy early and instead gain from waiting for the price to fall until it hits a level they consider fair.

  content: What happens during the Redemption Pool period?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: Redemption pools are special pools that allow projects to progressively distribute a token over a defined time period in exchange for a specified base token (In some cases this could be releasing a governance token in exchange for LP). During the Redemption Pool period, users can exchange the base token for the project's token, which contributes to the collective decision of the asset's fair value.
