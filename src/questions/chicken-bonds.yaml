  content: Which of the following statements are true regarding buckets in chicken-bonds?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: |
                       The assets that the user uses to bond are initially stored in the pending bucket.
                       If the user then decides to chicken-in, their funds are sent to the Reserve (according to the bTokens generated, to keep the backing ratio constant)  and                 Pending buckets (The tokens left over after depositing funds in the Reserve bucket). Note: this is not the order of the flow, but the logic of it.
  answerKeys:
    - A
  difficultyLevel: "Medium"
  choices:
    - content: When the user deposits money in chicken-bonds, it first goes to the Pending bucket
      key: A
      
    - content: When the user deposits money in chicken-bonds, it goes to the Reserve bucket first
      key: B
    - content: When the user deposits money in chicken-bonds, it goes to the Permanent bucket                   first
      key: C
    - content: When the user performs a chicken-in, the chickened funds all go to the Permanent bucket

  type: SingleChoice
  content: Which of these factors make sure that the backing ratio ( tokens in reserve bucket / boosted token supply) always increases?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: After every chicken-in event, an amount of underlying tokens is sent to the reserve bucket such that the current backing ratio remains constant, i.e the percentage of increase in underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket will always be constantly proportioned to the percentage increase in the total number of bTokens. And, Reserve bucket accumulates yield from all three buckets, constantly increasing the backing ratio.
  answerKeys:
    - D
  difficultyLevel: "Medium"
  choices:
    - content: The percentage increase in total number of bTokens is always kept constantly proportioned to the amount of underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket
      key: A
      
    - content: The percentage increase in total number of bTokens is always kept constantly proportioned to the amount of underlying tokens in the Pending bucket
      key: B
      
    - content: The Reserve bucket keeps accumulating yield from all the three buckets because of which the backing ratio will keep increasing between subsequent chicken-in events.

  hint: NoHint

  content: Which of these could be viewed as an advantage of using chicken-bonds (from the protocols perspective)
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: It ensures that the protocol can incentivize users for long term participation since long term participation of users does not mean that the protocol needs to bring extra capital (unlike in staking). Can help to hold a soft peg on the underlying token, if needed.

    - A

  type: MultipleChoice
  content: Which of these is a possible drawback of chicken-bonds and bTokens?
  hint: NoHint
  explanation: The breakeven (the time taken for the accrued bToken to cross the value of deposited underlying token) time could be too long to make the bonding profitable. In these times, user might want to buy bToken from a DEX and become an LP, but that could also be not profitable since bTokens trade at a premium above their price and the LP APY might not be enough to compensate for the premium.
  answerKeys:
    - B
    - C
  difficultyLevel: "Medium"
  choices:
    - content: The user can sometimes be locked from chickening-out
      key: A
      
    - content: The breakeven time for a bond could be too long for a user to make it profitable 
      key: B
      
    - content: Buying bTokens at a premium from a DEX might not be useful if the APY offered for being an LP is not profitable.
      key: C
