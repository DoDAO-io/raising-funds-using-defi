    What is the structure of Juicebox and how is it flexible to accommodate
    different projects?
  hint: 'Nohint    '
  explanation: >-
    One of the key things to look out for in communities as they grow is if they
    are flexible to adapt to changes overtime. This is why Juicebox lets
    projects adapt their rules and conditions as projects grow and members
    increase.
