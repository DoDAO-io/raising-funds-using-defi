 ## Bond Protocol

##### What is Bond Protocol?  

- [ ]  A trading platform
- [x]  A platform that allows any project to acquire liquidity for their DAO or protocol by selling bonds
- [ ]  A DeFi exchange platform
- [ ]  A platform that allows any project to issue their native tokens
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Bond Protocol (Olympus Pro) is a platform that allows any project to acquire liquidity for their DAO or protocol by selling bonds. Bond Protocol is, at its core, a service for protocols wishing to use bonds in their emissions programmes with minimal overhead and maximum impact. They give infrastructure, experience, and exposure to partners. Projects need only bring a token and a goal.

##### What is the advantage of issuing bonds for a protocol?  

- [ ]  Increase project runway, reduce insolvency risks
- [ ]  Acquire liquidity at lower long-term cost
- [x]  Both of the above
- [ ]  None of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Most protocols are over-exposed to their native governance token, with most treasuries having <10% diversification. Issuing bonds allows funds for development and investment in strategic initiatives to increase protocol viability and longevity. Also, Protocols pay a lot to rent liquidity via inflationary incentives paid in their native governance token. High incentives paid to mercenary capital can create negative feedback loops that destroy value for the protocol and token holders.

##### What can bond purchasers do with Bond Tokens?  

- [ ]  Use as collateral
- [ ]  Exchange between wallets
- [ ]  Use in governance
- [x]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Bond purchasers receive Bond Tokens (tokenized bonds) that represent their positions which allow for the creation of secondary markets. The tokenized bonds can be used as collateral, exchanged between wallets, or even used in governance.

##### What is the advantage of Bond Protocol's contract architecture?  

- [x]  Makes it easy to add new bond assets and auction interfaces
- [ ]  Makes it easy to increase project runway
- [ ]  Makes it easy to reduce insolvency risks
- [ ]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Bond Protocolâ€™s contract architecture makes it easy to add new bond assets and auction interfaces. Protocols will be able to select from a variety of bond markets that best suit their unique attributes. Initially launched with two types of bond vesting, Fixed-Term (ERC1155) and Fixed-Expiry (ERC20).

##### What is the main difference between fixed-term bonds and fixed-expiry bonds?  

- [ ]  Fixed-term bonds are tokenized as ERC20, while fixed-expiry bonds are tokenized as ERC1155
- [x]  Fixed-term bonds vest a set amount of time after purchase, while fixed-expiry bonds vest at a specific timestamp
- [ ]  Fixed-term bonds have a longer vesting period than fixed-expiry bonds
- [ ]  All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: In Fixed-term bonds each position vests a set amount of time after purchase (based on UTC timestamp) and tokenized as ERC1155. In Fixed-expiry bonds all purchases vest at a specific timestamp and minimum 3 days vesting to maximum 9 months (on Bond Protocol front-end) is required. Fixed-expiry bonds are tokenized as ERC20.

##### What is the minimum vesting period for fixed-expiry bonds on Bond Protocol?  

- [ ]  1 day
- [ ]  2 days
- [x]  3 days
- [ ]  4 days
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The minimum vesting period for fixed-expiry bonds on Bond Protocol is 3 days.

##### What are the downsides of giving native tokens to Liquidity Providers?  

- [ ]  A) They are not locked to the platform
- [ ]  B) They can move to another platform if rewards are not good enough
- [ ]  C) Token price may drop due to excess supply in the market
- [x]  D) All of the above
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Giving of the native tokens to Liquidity Providers can have a few downsides such as - The liquidity providers are not locked to the platform, i.e. whenever they feel the rewards are not good enough, they can move to another platform. If you give less rewards/tokens, it will be difficult to attract Liquidity Providers, and if you give more rewards, the token price will drop because of the excess supply in the market. All the liquidity provided by LPs is temporary, i.e. in their control and they can move it whenever they want.

##### What is the purpose of a vesting period in bonds?  

- [ ]  To attract more liquidity
- [ ]  To increase the value of the native token
- [x]  To ensure that users do not sell all the discounted tokens at once for a quick profit
- [ ]  To improve the platform's functionality
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: The vesting period is used to prevent users from selling all the discounted tokens at once for a quick profit.

##### Why are bonds offered at a discounted rate?  

- [ ]  To increase the value of the native token
- [x]  To incentivize users to sell to the protocol, rather than the open market
- [ ]  To attract more liquidity
- [ ]  To improve the platform's functionality
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: To encourage users to sell to the protocol rather than the open market, bonds are offered at a discounted rate.

##### What are the benefits of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL)?  

- [x]  It allows a protocol to provide guarantees to users that there is always sufficient liquidity for normal market operations
- [x]  It transforms liquidity from a liability to a revenue source
- [ ]  It transforms liquidity from a revenue source to a liability
- [x]  POL allows for additional yield farming opportunities
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) allows a protocol to provide guarantees to users that there is always sufficient liquidity for normal market operations. Without POL and relying on external liquidity providers, in distress market conditions, liquidity is often pulled from the protocol, exacerbating the situation with less exit liquidity (liquidity death spiral). Another benefit is that POL transforms liquidity from a liability to a revenue source. Every swap transaction in a pool contributes a 0.3%/0.25% (Uniswap/Sushiswap) fee to the LPs. With POL, as liquidity is permanently locked in the treasury, these fees provide a constant source of revenue for the protocol. Additionally, POL allows for additional yield farming opportunities, such as the Onsen program offered by Sushiswap, where protocols can have their liquidity pair listed for SUSHI rewards. Once successfully listed, the protocols can deposit their SLP tokens into the Onsen menu and farm SUSHI tokens.
