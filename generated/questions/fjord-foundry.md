##### How should the starting price of an LBP be set in comparison to what is believed to be the reasonable price?  

- [ ]  The same
- [x]  Significantly higher
- [ ]  Comparable
- [ ]  Significantly lower
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Consider the beginning price of your LBP to be the ceiling you wish to set for the token sale. This may appear contradictory, but because LBPs operate differently than other token sales, your starting price should be significantly higher than what you believe to be the reasonable price. This does not imply that you are attempting to sell the token for more than it is worth.

##### What is the goal of setting a high initial price in a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)?  

- [x]  To sell the token for more than it is worth
- [ ]  To allow the changing pool weights to fully effect the price
- [ ]  To incentivize consumers to buy early
- [ ]  To keep the price low
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Setting a high initial price allows the changing pool weights of your LBP to fully effect the price, gradually dropping it until market equilibrium is established. Unlike previous token sale methods, such as bonding curves, consumers are disincentivized to buy early and instead gain from waiting for the price to fall until it hits a level they consider fair.

##### Who can participate in LBPs?  

- [ ]  Those who have been whitelisted
- [x]  Anyone
- [ ]  Only people with enough money
- [ ]  Participants who meet the minimum or maximum allocation
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: On Fjord Foundry, whales, VCs, and other large players are unable to game the start of liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs), which means the average person is given the opportunity to participate in these opportunities without worrying about asymmetric information that can affect launch events.

##### What feature of Fjord Foundry makes it resistant to sniper bots?  

- [ ]  A virtual queueing system for distributing tickets fairly

- [ ]  A blockchain-based authentication system for tickets
- [x]  A built-in high-low price discovery mechanism
  
Hint: NoHint

##### What happens during the Redemption Pool period?  

- [ ]  Users pay for a governance token in exchange for liquidation tokens.
- [ ]  Users can exchange the project's token for the base token.
- [x]  Users can exchange the base token for the project's token.
- [ ]  Users decide an asset's fair value by making collective decisions.
  
Hint: NoHint
         
Explanation: Redemption pools are special pools that allow projects to progressively distribute a token over a defined time period in exchange for a specified base token (In some cases this could be releasing a governance token in exchange for LP). During the Redemption Pool period, users can exchange the base token for the project's token, which contributes to the collective decision of the asset's fair value.

- [ ]  A. Price starts low and increases based on a pre-configured price decay curve.
- [ ]  B. Price starts high and drops based on a pre-configured price decay curve.
- [ ]  C. Price remains constant and does not change.
- [x]  D. Price is determined by a number of factors such as demand and thus does not necessarily increase or decrease
  
Hint: NoHint
