          "details": "## Traditional Fundraising\nTraditional methods of fundraising can be quite limiting and outdated, often not taking into consideration new techniques that could make the project more appealing to not just venture capitalists, but to the community or customers as well. Some limitations of existing fundraising methods include:\n\n- Projects that speak VC-friendly language can easily raise funds, limiting access for first time founders or creators. \n- The process can be time-consuming and frustrating, often requiring a lot of upfront work with no guarantee of success. \n- Price is set by the founders or VCs, without any price discovery. \n- Most investment opportunities are only available to accredited investors, i.e. people earning more than $200,000 (or a few other constraints)\n\n## DeFi Fundraising\nIn DeFi projects, one or more tokens can be issued and then sold by the project using some of the fundraising primitives that have been developed in the ecosystem.  One thing to note is that many of the projects in Crypto might not adhere to security laws (selling of the shares/stocks in open market) and it is very important to do your proper research before you decide to use one of the DeFi primitives for fundraising. The most common DeFi primitives for fundraising currently used are:\n1. Bonding Curves - Used for bootstrapping funds where the early investors are rewarded more than the people of join at a later stage\n2. Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming - In this native tokens are given to the investors who provide funds that can be used for trading, lending or borrowing. In this technique, almost full control of the funds remain with investors and they can opt out when they want.\n3. Staking - \n\n\n\n\nInnovation is key when it comes to fundraising, and by thinking outside the box, you can increase your chances of attracting the right people to support your project. Try to come up with unique ways to sell your project and get people interested in what you're doing - this way, you'll be more likely to succeed in raising the funds you need.\n\n\n- Unlike existing crowdfunding platforms, Catalyst offers incentive-driven fundraising where backers can potentially earn a return on their contribution.\n- Enables Price Discovery\n- \n\n\n\n## Trust with Blockchain\n There are solutions out there in cooperative structures: communities come together around shared goals (the commons) and value their local communities and environments. They have their own non-hierarchical governance structures and decision-making processes. These are great solutions, but they have a problem. They rely on trust, which today is person to person — this doesn’t scale. So how can we scale this trust and these coordination mechanisms to apply commons-type solutions on a global scale?\n\n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/giveth/the-commons-stack-scaling-the-commons-to-re-prioritize-people-and-the-planet-fdc076aec4eb\n- https://medium.com/giveth/blockchain-economies-and-the-commons-cdb67dd1a163",

          "details": "### What is a Bonding Curve?\n\nThe Bonding Curves Offerings (BCO) provides a way for projects to efficiently, fairly, and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters in a transparent way. \n\nA bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between price and token supply. In other words, it's a way to visualize how the price of a token changes as more tokens are minted. Here's an example of a bonding curve, where `currentPrice = tokenSupply²`:\n\n\n<img style=\"max-height:300px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/simple_bonding_curve.png\" />\n\n`Source: https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/`\n\nThe Bonding Curve explains how the price of a token is determined by the number of tokens that have already been minted. In the case of an exponential curve, such as the one shown in the example, the growth rate will speed up as the number of tokens minted increases.\n\nWhen someone buys a token, each successive buyer will need to pay a slightly higher price per token, which could generate profits for the earliest investors. As more people learn about the project and buying continues, the value of each token will go up slowly along the bonding curve. As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a price advantage for early adopters. Early buyers have a considerable upside potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low as well.\n\nEarly buyers of tokens have a considerable upside potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low. As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, early adopters can benefit from a price advantage. By getting in early, buyers can take advantage of the potential for growth as prices increase as more people enter the market.\n\nThe most significant advantage that Bonding Curves have over traditional asset pricing methods is the fact that the pricing of assets is transparent, set in stone(on-chain), and unchanging at all points. The market is able to reach a collective agreement through well-defined rules, without needing outside intervention. Because the cost per token is decided by the curve/formula, every person involved knows how much each token will cost ahead of time. This allows for a honest and just market where everyone knows the score.\n\n### Buying/Minting tokens from bonding curve:\n- A bonding curve smart contract is created that allows users to buy/mint a new token (eg. Bonding Curve Token, BCT) with by supplying a currency for example USDC.\n- The price of BCT is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, USDC.\n- By providing USDC to the contract, the user can buy the new BCT token through a smart contract. \n- After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)\n\n### Key benefits of bonding curves:\n- Limitless Supply - Normally there is no limit to the number of tokens that can be minted.\n- Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and decreases according to the number of tokens minted.\n- Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more than token n-1.\n- Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any time.\n\n### Augmented Bonding Curves\nThe Augmented Bonding Curve design can be conceptualized as a typical bonding curve with the addition of a funding pool, a token lock-up/vesting mechanism, and inter-system feedback loops. The system is launched in two stages: the Hatch Phase and the Open Phase.\n\n<img style=\"max-height:600px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/augmented_bonding_curve.png\" />\n`Source: https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751`\n\nDuring the Hatch Phase, initial contributors (i.e. founding members of the organization, devoted contributors, initial investors or “Hatchers”) participate in a hatch sale. The point of this phase is to gather contributors and pool capita. A percentage is put into the Reserve Pool and “bonded” to the curve (i.e. minting tokens and determining the initial spot price used during the Open Phase) and a percentage is put into the Funding Pool. The capital in the Funding Pool remains un-bonded as a floating source of capital that can be distributed as real capital outside of the bonding curve. For their contribution, Hatchers receive newly minted tokens, specific to the Commons, in return.\n\nIn a typical bonding curve system, these tokens could then be burned at any point or after an arbitrary temporal deadline. In an augmented bonding curve system, tokens minted during the Hatch Phase are locked (burning is disabled) in a vesting process. This vesting period combats any harmful early speculation/arbitrage that would affect the stability of the Reserve Pool. Although burning tokens to withdraw DAI is disabled, Hatchers’ tokens are far from useless — they can still be used to curate options for future capital allocation. Early in the system, this token usage is critical to ensure the capital in the Funding Pool is allocated to community initiatives, research projects and development milestones which will help grow the commons.\n\nAfter the goal for the Hatch Sale is met, the vesting process is initialized and the system enters the Open Phase. In the Open Phase, anyone can mint tokens by contributing DAI into the curve, hence becoming ‘members of the Commons’. Their contribution will go directly into the Reserve Pool, returning newly minted unlocked tokens that can be burned or used to vote within the system. For the Hatchers, the first inter-system feedback loop comes into play. The Hatchers tokens are slowly unlocked in correlation to how much capital has been allocated to fund projects that support the commons. This means that for the Hatchers’ tokens to vest, capital from the Funding Pool has to be allocated to fund projects that positively impact the commons. With this vesting process and introduction of a governance model (we will be exploring Conviction Voting), members of the Commons (token holders), are economically incentivized to participate in the system’s governance process to allocate funding to curated projects that have the most beneficial impact on the Commons. This combats a known incentive misalignment observed in capital-allocating DAOs — in which capital allocations are rare because members are too selective or stingy with funds.\n\nFinally, whenever tokens are burned (withdrawn for DAI → $), an exit tax is enacted on liquidation. As Members “cash out” and liquidate their tokens for DAI, a small percentage of their returns are sent back into the Funding Pool, allowing for the simultaneous funding of the commons while contributors are earning returns. This means the system always benefits, even if speculators are just looking to make returns.\n\nThe goal of the system is to attract new members of the Commons that see the impact of the Commons and want to be a part of the movement so that the Funding Pool can grow.\n\n\n\n\n \n### References\n- https://hackernoon.com/what-are-bonding-curve-offerings-xi2k34bm\n- https://dev.to/ceonyema/bonding-curve-offering-an-efficient-and-transparent-funding-model-4oae\n- https://www.linumlabs.com/articles/bonding-curves-the-what-why-and-shapes-behind-it\n- https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/\n- https://medium.com/molecule-blog/designing-different-fundraising-scenarios-with-sigmoidal-token-bonding-curves-ceafc734ed97\n- https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8\n- https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751\n",

The rewards are typically paid out in the form of the platform's native token, and are designed to incentivize users to help increase the liquidity of the platform. This can help to improve the overall functioning of the platform, making it more attractive to other users and helping to drive further adoption.\n\n## Yield Farming\nYield farming is a type of liquidity mining that involves providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in order to earn returns in the form of various cryptocurrencies. Yield farming typically involves lending, borrowing, or staking assets in order to earn interest, receive dividends, or earn other types of returns. It is often done through smart contracts on blockchain platforms, which automate the process and provide transparency and security. The term \"yield farming\" is used because the returns earned through these activities can be quite high, similar to the returns earned through traditional farming.\n\n## Liquidity Mining vs Yield Farming\nThe main difference between liquidity mining and yield farming is that liquidity mining typically refers to the process of providing liquidity to a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform in order to earn rewards, while yield farming specifically refers to the process of providing liquidity in order to earn high returns through lending, borrowing, or staking assets.\n\nBoth liquidity mining and yield farming are used to incentivize users to help increase the liquidity of a DeFi platform, but yield farming is more focused on the earning of high returns, and the term \"yield farming\" is often used to emphasize the high returns earned through the process.\n\nAnother point to note is that liquidity mining is not limited to DeFi, it could be used in traditional finance too, while yield farming is specific to DeFi ecosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Borrowers issue bonds to raise money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of time.\n\nWhen you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when it \"matures,\" or comes due after a set period of time.\n\n### DeFi Bonds\nThere is a lot of difference between bonds in DeFi and traditional bonds, just like there is a lot of difference between tokens and stocks. In some cases, projects might just be using the name \"bond\" for particular offerings, but the mechanics can be totally different from traditional bonds.\n\nThere are a few common mechanics that we often see being used in bonds as a way for DeFi projects to raise capital, these include:\n\n1. **Exchange of Native Token**: In return for selling their native token, projects will ask for a stable token or one that is less volatile in exchange.\n2. **Discount on Tokens**: To make the bonds more appealing, projects will sell them at a \n3. **Protocol owned Liquidity**: This is often used when a project needs to gain access to various tokens that are utilized as part of the product. For instance, to demonstrate the full potential of a Decentralized Exchange or Lending & Borrowing, protocols require access to a great deal of liquidity of different tokens.\n4. **Secondary Markets**: Most of these bonds can be sold at a secondary market place, so the investor doesn't have to wait for the bond to mature.\n",

This network’s consensus mechanism involves identifying previously unknown prime numbers, and to date, Primecoin mining has led to the discovery of nearly 32 million prime numbers! In other words, the architects of this network succeeded in building an economy around the act of finding primes.\n\nAs a CPU-mined cryptocurrency, there’s a distinct possibility that most of the mining being done on the Primecoin network is the work of botnets. Simply put, some jerk may have built malware to infect your grandma’s computer and force it to look for prime numbers. With all due respect to grandma, that is pretty awesome from the standpoint of mathematical research! We commend Primecoin on providing an outlet for such productive malfeasance.\n\n\nAnd of course, this story would be incomplete if we didn’t mention the Folding@home project. Predating the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper by a full eight years, this incredible effort allows everyday people to contribute spare computing power to medical research that may hold answers to questions about Alzheimer’s, some cancers, and other serious maladies.\n\nAt first, participants were asked to donate this computing power out of pure altruism. Later on, however, two teams created cryptocurrencies to reward those who take part in Folding@home: FoldingCoin, a token on the Bitcoin network; and CureCoin, the native asset of a dedicated blockchain.\n\nCureCoin & FoldingCoin successfully built a scalable economic system around an altruistic cause that allows all participants to profit accordingly to the value that they produce, as is typically seen in an efficient for-profit business models.\n\nFolding@home has inspired other distributed computing projects as well. UC Berkeley’s BOINC platform allows computer owners to contribute processing power to a range of efforts, including the search for extraterrestrial life via SETI@home. They can even receive rewards in the form of Gridcoin.\n\nNamecoin, Primecoin, and the coins attached to the @home projects have opened up a very interesting possibility. People who don’t care at all about curing cancer, or finding aliens, or any other underlying cause, may still ‘contribute’ to progress in that field by speculating on a related cryptocurrency, pushing up its price so that other people who aren’t interested in the topic still take notice and start mining it for profit. To put it another way, these projects have successfully created economies in which every participant, acting in their own self-interest, supports a worthy mission.\n\n### References\n- https://medium.com/giveth/blockchain-economies-and-the-commons-cdb67dd1a163",

It is in opposition to 1:1 as that is plutocratic and based only on capital needs. It is instead based on the number of contributors as opposed to the amount funded, reducing whale power and favoring democratic.\nExample: You raise a grant that gets $100 from 100 contributors, and I raise a grant that gets $100 from 1 contributor, despite both grants being donated $100, you will get 99% of the matching pool. It’s a cool mechanism because it is a collective intelligence mechanism that routes money to where the  “poor and the many” have an advantage over the rich and the few.\n\nYou may give “only” a dollar, but really you are part of building an aggregate signal of what public goods folks want to see funded. Problems:\n* sybil attacks, needing to raise matching pool funds.\n* It’s like voting! Mitigating a plutocratic methodology with a one person: one vote identity style.\n\n\n## Retroactive Public Goods Funding \nhttps://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1680\n\nKarl Floersch is an inspiration for this mechanism, as they are implementing it at Optimism. It is a way of doing public goods funding retroactively. At Optimism, they are creating a committee of experts, and they’re channeling revenue from the Optimism network and asking that committee of experts which things in the past have delivered value to the ecosystem. The idea is that more talent will be directed toward developing public goods funding in the present based on the assurance that they will be rewarded for it in the future.\n\n## Hypercerts \nhttps://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=2680\nOwocki is working on this mechanism with Protocol Labs. Carbon credits have market value; Hypercerts can generalize the magic of carbon credits into any impact vector. For example, I fix some potholes or pick up x-amount trash, etc. Any impact DAO could issue Hypercerts when their members have positive impact, and then bootstrap a marketplace of impact evaluators and get people who want to collect Hypercerts to show their virtue. Web2 = virtue-signaling. Web3 = proof-of-virtue.\n\nSo we’re bootstrapping a triple-sided marketplace, where impact DAOs can issue Hypercerts, impact evaluators can stamp their legitimacy, and people who care can purchase them. Sum value is that any impact DAO can go from worrying about how much impact they can capture to how much they can create. That systematically shifts the incentives towards impact DAOs to having a business model, which means more capital and talent can rotate into impact DAOs. If you can create a decentralized signal generation collective intelligence marketplace, where people are issuing, evaluating and purchasing Hypercerts, you can have a decentralized data source about the impact.\n\nChallenge: why haven’t they worked in the past? Impact markets aren’t new. Owocki thinks the decentralized, blockchain aspect will make it reliable and successful. Bootstrapping the buy pressure will be the hardest part. We need to use social and cultural power to collect these things, then they’ll be successful. The dream is to create a market around it.\n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/giveth/coordination-mechanisms-notes-from-a-conversation-with-griff-green-kevin-owocki-af95f3e831b1",

In chicken bonds, users bond an amount of the protocol tokens in turn for virtually accruing newly issued boosted tokens (bTokens) which have a higher return than the yield on the underlying token.  After some time has passed, the user can decide whether to mint the bTokens which have accrued virtually and give up their possession of the underlying tokens (Chicken-in) or to cancel the bond and get back their principal amount of the underlying token (Chicken-out). Different stages of the bond are expressed via artwork as NFTs, these NFTs can be transferred and point to the bond, meaning whoever owns the NFT is in possession of the bond. The longer a bond has been going on for, the rarer the NFT it is associated with.  The bTokens can either be redeemed for the underlying tokens from the protocol, or be swapped in a DEX depending on whichever is more profitable to the user. Moreover, the bTokens can be bought in DEXs as a form of investment if the user believes in the long term appreciation of its value. \n\nNow that we have briefly introduced what chicken bonds are, let us dive a little deeper and see how they work behind the scenes and some of its advantages.\n"

          "details": "### Learnings\n\nIt is understood that the user bonds the protocol tokens in return for a virtual accrual of bTokens which the user can choose to claim (Chicken-in) or not (Chicken-out). But the question of how the bTokens provide more yield than the underlying tokens and how it is feasible for the protocol arises. To answer that, we need to understand where the bonded underlying tokens go. But first let us have a brief overview of the bonding itself.\n\nUsers can benefit from the system by,\n* **Bonding:** The user can make a profit by bonding, achieving breakeven and then redeeming the bTokens\n\n* **Investing:** Buy the bTokens on the market as a long-term investment with amplified returns and limited downside risks.\n* **Sell the bond:** Sell the chicken-bond NFTs in NFT market places.\n\n\n\nAt any point in time, the holder of the bond can decide to:\n* **Claim bond (Chicken In):** claim and mint the accrued balance of bTokens in exchange for the deposited tokens.\n* **Cancel bond (Chicken Out):** retrieve the deposited tokens (principal) forgoing the accrued balance of bTokens.\n* **Users can sell their bonds:** Represented as NFTs on the secondary market like OpenSea. This especially makes sense for bonds that have accrued a significant amount of bTokens without breaking even yet.\nNow that we have that clear,  let us see where the bonded tokens go and how it aids in the bTokens achieving a boosted yield.\n**Buckets**\n\nBuckets are reserves of the underlying token. There are three “buckets” of tokens where the bonded tokens are held. Think of these as an internal segregation of assets by the protocol to have better clarity over how much assets they hold and make use of in different aspects of the chicken bond. \n\nThese are Pending, Reserve and Permanent buckets. The protocol generates yield on the tokens from all three buckets and this yield from all the three buckets is funneled into the Reserve bucket and bTokens can be redeemed for a pro-rata ratio of the Reserve bucket.\n\n**Flow**\n\nFirst, when a user bonds their tokens, the tokens are sent to the Pending bucket. Then, depending on whether the user chickens in, the “chickened-in” funds are sent to the other two buckets, Reserve and Permanent.\n\nThe tokens in the Reserve bucket are directly responsible for the backing of the generated bTokens, while the tokens in the Permanent bucket are permanently owned by the system and are used to generate yield to be funneled into the Reserve bucket. \n\n**Boosted yield**\n\n**Backing ratio never decreases**\n\nWhenever somebody Chickens In, the protocol expands the bToken supply in the same proportion as it increases the Reserve Bucket backing them. Let us see how.  The protocol makes sure that the backing ratio, given by ``tokens in reserve bucket / boosted token supply`` never decreases. This means that whenever there is a chicken-in event and bTokens are minted, the amount of underlying tokens sent to the reserve will be such that the backing ratio never decreases (or remains the same as it was before the chicken-in event). \n\nThis is done by levying a maximum cap (as we saw on the graph) on the amount of bTokens generated according to the current backing rate. The cap is defined as ``boosted_token_supply/reserve_bucket ``. \n\nTo better understand, let us consider an example  For instance, let’s assume a user bonds 120 TKN, and the current backing ratio is 1.5. Therefore the cap for that bond would be 80 bTKN (= 120 / 1.5). After some time and reaching **80%** of the cap the user claims the bond. So the system mints 64 bTKN for the user, and the bonded amount is split in 96 TKN **(80%)** which go to the Reserve Bucket, and 24 TKN (the remaining 20%) which are deposited in the Permanent bucket.\n\n**Boosted yield and rising price floor**\n\nOn top of the yield token always being backed at a set minimum ratio per each chicken-in event, the Reserve bucket is constantly accruing yield from the other two buckets which means that the backing ratio keeps increasing as time passes. For example, say at some time T, we had a backing ratio 1.5, at some time T+X we would have a higher backing ratio, say 2. Because the backing ratio never decreases per chicken-in event and on top of that, the amount of underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket keeps increasing owing to yield from the tokens in the other two buckets. \n\nRemember, bTokens can be redeemed for a pro-rata ratio of the Reserve bucket. Since the number of underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket increases faster than the total number of bTokens according to the above logic, a scenario where the price floor for the bTokens keeps increasing is created (Meaning the amount of underlying tokens redeemable for the given amount of bTokens keeps increasing, theoretically). \n\n**Summary and the flywheel effect**\n\nTo sum up, Given that the yield from all three buckets is sent to the Reserve Bucket, the backing ratio (price floor) will grow faster than the value of a simple portfolio of the underlying token. By pricing in the amplified growth, the bTokens should trade at a premium against their price floor, driving a flywheel: the more people bond, the more yield is retained for the bToken holders. A higher yield in turn increases the price premium, making bonding more attractive through a higher APR.\n\nTo ensure that bonding remains attractive when the premium drops, the protocol may automatically adjust the accrual rate (steepness of the accrual curve) using a controller targeting an average Chicken In time or bond age.\n"

          "details": "### The advantages\n\nContrasting chicken bonds with another way which protocols use to deepen liquidity of their token, staking. We have seen that in staking, protocols initially offer a very high APR to attract users to deposit tokens in their reserves and thus deepen their Protocol Owned Liquidity which can help the protocol in gaining stability for their token, and credibility in the market. But these high APRs are often unsustainable and as soon as the protocol starts offering a more practical APR on staking, the users start pulling out their funds since they no longer find this to be a profitable investment. In this system we see that the protocol cannot reward users for their prolonged participation, as the APR is likely to decrease in the long run. \nOn the other hand, chicken bonds help protocols deepen their liquidity by providing a novel bonding mechanism which rewards users for their long term participation while simultaneously deepening their Protocol Owned Liquidity. Ofcourse, on the user side of things there is always the issue of volatility of the bToken or the underlying token in DEXs which could mean that user incurs a loss but in theory, the user can yield more with the bToken than they would with the underlying token which is an attractive offer for the users holding the underlying token, who are the target users for this mechanism. \n \nHelps deepen the liquidity of the protocol, and to hold a soft peg. \nThe bond has no maturity, meaning the user can choose to reap the benefits or quit if they do not find it to be profitable at anytime, which is often not possible in staking. This makes chicken bonds more attractive to users.\nThe user can obtain dynamic NFTs whose rarity can vary depending on the time that has passed since chickening in, etc. These NFTs are proof of ownership of the bonds, meaning that the bonds can be sold and bought in markets, opening new investment opportunities.\nOther options of generating liquidity often involve recurring expenses from the protocol, which is unsustainable unless there is a lot of funding for the protocol. But in the case of chicken bonds, all the protocol needs to capture liquidity is time, and ofcourse users to bond, the users will start using chicken bonds when they realize that it is worthwhile.\n\nAn example of the advantage of bTokens with the use of bLUSD. Say LUSD is trading at a price premium to its $1 peg, as long as LUSD is trading above its peg, users will mint LUSD and try to take advantage of arbitrage. With bLUSD, users can get compounded yield on LUSD which makes the arbitrage option more attractive. This way, as long as there is a price premium for LUSD, users will be more incentivized to invest it in chicken bonds and reap more benefits. While simultaneously, the LUSD liquidity will be deepened, making it stabler and helping to reduce the price premium, which is what is expected of a stablecoin (to trade at peg value).\n"

          "details": "### Drawbacks using LUSD/bLUSD as an example\n\nLike with all protocols, the b.protocol (chicken-bonds) also has its own downsides. Let us look at a few of them with the help of Liquity as an example.\n\nSometimes, it could be more profitable to chicken out and simply buy bLUSD in an exchange than to accrue it from being bonded. Also, the idea of rebonding (redeeming bToken from a previous bond to bond again with a larger amount of underlying token) can sometimes prove to be too time taking and providing very little yield in the end whereas the user can just buy bLUSD and become an LP for a better yield (a user would rebond only when the bLUSD value has achieved breakeven with the LUSD invested, which can take a long time sometimes). Though as people chicken out to buy bLUSD, the rebond time to make a profitable chicken-in decreases, but the user can chicken out and not buy bLUSD at all, users might face loss in such a scenario.\n\n\nbLUSD is often trading at a premium, if user buys bLUSD to become LP in a curve pool, it is very likely that the user will not be able to cover the premium that they paid using the APY being offered by being an LP. Also, it is interesting to note that as users chicken-out, the APY for bLUSD supply decreases. In the first scenario, the only other option for the user to make any progress with bLUSD being buying it in an exchange and becoming LP is again not solid, since the APY for the bLUSD supply will decrease and the bLUSD premium will be too much for the reducing APY to cover. In other words, if the rebonding proves to be not profitable, or time taking, the user might want to become bLUSD LP, but that option is also not great since the bLUSD price and the APY it earns are not at par with each other (you would want more APY than the bLUSD premium price).\n"
