Many of these companies eventually outgrow their original objectives and begin to pursue a purely financial route, focusing solely on metrics such as revenue, profits, and growth.\n\nIn how many startups do we see\n- Funds being raised from the community\n- Profits being shared with the community\n- Important decisions taken collectively by employees and customers\n- Sharing profits with customers\n- Having customers as investors\n- Longer term members being compensated more than short term members\n- All the employees as share holders with sizeable share percentages\n\nDeFi makes it possible for anyone to invest in a project. Early investors who take on more risk can potentially receive greater rewards. Additionally, unlike traditional VC models, investors are not locked into multi-year fund cycles. They can invest and then resell their tokens whenever they want. \n\nWe will see many new ways that projects can raise money through DeFi or by using DeFi techniques. This will provide more opportunities for people to get involved in projects and potentially receive greater rewards for their investment.",

          "details": "## Traditional Fundraising Situations\nTraditional methods of fundraising can be quite limiting and outdated, often not taking into consideration new techniques that could make the project more appealing to not just venture capitalists, but to the community or customers as well. Some limitations of existing fundraising methods include:\n\n### Problems faced by Founders\n- It is easier for projects that speak VC-friendly language to raise funds, limiting access for first-time creators or founders.\n- Often requiring a lot of upfront work with no guarantee of success, the process can be time-consuming and frustrating\n- In most cases, founders start with a vision and mission, but due to the financial goals involved, the focus is completely on maximizing profits, with little attention given to the company's impact on society.\n\n### Problems faced by Investors\n- Price is set by the founders or VCs, without any price discovery.\n- Before the product market fit is found (startup profits significantly), it is difficult to determine a price.\n- VCs have to guess without knowing how the product will be perceived.\n- Many investors shy away from venture capital firms because of locking cycles of 5-10 years.\n\n### Other Pressing Issues\n- A majority of investment opportunities are only available to accredited investors, i.e. people earning more than $200,000 per year.\n- As companies only go public after growth has normalized, public markets aren't rewarding any more\n- Most startup companies spend far more money to acquire a customer than they will ever gain from them since there is minimal transparency in the process.\n- Often, your community is your product. Current business models don't allow community members to share in the gains and risks of their projects.\n\n\n## DeFi Fundraising\nIn DeFi projects, one or more tokens can be issued and then sold by the project using some of the fundraising primitives that have been developed in the ecosystem.  One thing to note is that many of the projects in Crypto might not adhere to security laws (selling of the shares/stocks in open market) and it is very important to do your proper research before you decide to use one of the DeFi primitives for fundraising. The most common DeFi primitives for fundraising currently used are:\n1. **Bonding Curves** - Bootstrapping funds with earlier investors being rewarded more lucrative than those who join the project later on.\n2. **Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming** - Offering native tokens to investors in exchange for providing liquidity to the protocol which can be used for trading, lending, or borrowing. This structure allows investors to have nearly full control over the funds and they can choose to exit the position when desired.\n3. **Staking** - Staking allows investors to deposit their funds with a protocol and earn interest on them. In the event of an unexpected loss of funds, some money may be deducted from the deposited funds. \n4. **DeFi Bonds** - DeFi bonds are an innovative mechanism that allows investors to purchase tokens at a discount. Investors purchase the bonds and then get access to the tokens once the bond matures.\n5. **Quadratic Funding** - In this crowdfunding method, money from a central matching pool is allocated based on which projects are more democratically supported as opposed to those into which more capital goes.\n6. **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools** - \n7. **Batch Auctions** -\n\nWe will cover each of these funding methods in the following sections. \n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/giveth/the-commons-stack-scaling-the-commons-to-re-prioritize-people-and-the-planet-fdc076aec4eb\n- https://medium.com/giveth/blockchain-economies-and-the-commons-cdb67dd1a163",

          "details": "### What is a Bonding Curve?\n\nThe Bonding Curves Offerings (BCO) provides a way for projects to efficiently, fairly, and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters in a transparent way. \n\nA bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between price and token supply. In other words, it's a way to visualize how the price of a token changes as more tokens are minted. Here's an example of a bonding curve, where `currentPrice = tokenSupply²`:\n\n\n<img style=\"max-height:300px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/simple_bonding_curve.png\" />\n\n`Source: https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/`\n\nThe Bonding Curve explains how the price of a token is determined by the number of tokens that have already been minted. In the case of an exponential curve, such as the one shown in the example, the growth rate will speed up as the number of tokens minted increases.\n\nWhen someone buys a token, each successive buyer will need to pay a slightly higher price per token, which could generate profits for the earliest investors. As more people learn about the project and buying continues, the value of each token will go up slowly along the bonding curve. As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a price advantage for early adopters. Early buyers have a considerable upside potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low as well.\n\nEarly buyers of tokens have a considerable upside potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low. As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, early adopters can benefit from a price advantage. By getting in early, buyers can take advantage of the potential for growth as prices increase as more people enter the market.\n\nThe most significant advantage that Bonding Curves have over traditional asset pricing methods is the fact that the pricing of assets is transparent, set in stone(on-chain), and unchanging at all points. The market is able to reach a collective agreement through well-defined rules, without needing outside intervention. Because the cost per token is decided by the curve/formula, every person involved knows how much each token will cost ahead of time. This allows for a honest and just market where everyone knows the score.\n\n### Buying/Minting tokens from bonding curve:\n- A bonding curve smart contract is created that allows users to buy/mint a new token (eg. Bonding Curve Token, ABC) with by supplying a currency for example USDC.\n- The price of ABC is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, USDC.\n- By providing USDC to the contract, the user can buy the new ABC token through a smart contract. \n- After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)\n- A ABC holder can choose to burn or sell their token back to the curve at any time. If the price of the token goes up after they purchase it, they will likely sell it at a profit (minus gas and fees). They will receive the bonded USDC back from the smart contract after their sell is approved.\n\n\n### Key benefits of bonding curves:\n- Limitless Supply - Normally there is no limit to the number of tokens that can be minted.\n- Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and decreases according to the number of tokens minted.\n- Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more than token n-1.\n- Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any time.\n\n### Limitations\n* Basic forms of bonding curves don't keep a minimal reserve that might be needed to bootstrap the project.\n* Users can buy or sell the tokens to the bonding curve, but minting of new tokens based on time schedule is not possible. This could be an issue for new projects that need to compensate for an initial burn rate.\n\n### Augmented Bonding Curves\nThe most basic form of a bonding curve is \"x = y.\" By adding more variables or constraints to the formula, you can make the bonding curve more suitable to the needs of your project. The Augmented Bonding Curve, explained below, is one such example of how bonding curves can be extended.\n\nThe Augmented Bonding Curve design can be conceptualized as a typical bonding curve with the addition of a funding pool, a token lock-up/vesting mechanism, and inter-system feedback loops. The system is launched in two stages: the Hatch Phase and the Open Phase.\n\n<img style=\"max-height:600px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/augmented_bonding_curve.png\" />\n\n`Source: https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751`\n\nThe Hatch Phase is designed to allow initial contributors (founding members, devoted contributors, initial investors, etc.) to participate in a hatch sale. The purpose of this phase is to gather contributors and pool capital. A percentage of the capital is put into the Reserve Pool and used to mint tokens and determine the initial spot price during the Open Phase. The remaining capital in the Funding Pool is un-bonded and can be distributed as real capital outside of the bonding curve.\n\nIn a typical bonding curve system, the tokens can be burned at any time. However, in an augmented bonding curve system, the tokens minted during the Hatch Phase are locked and cannot be burned. This is to prevent any early speculation or arbitrage that could affect the stability of the Reserve Pool. It's important to have funds locked early on in the system to make sure that the capital in the Funding Pool is allocated to community initiatives, research projects and development milestones that will help the commons grow.\n\nOnce the goal for the Hatch Sale is reached, the new tokens go into a reserve pool where they can be bought or sold according to the bonding curve. The Hatchers tokens are gradually unlocked through this vesting process.\n\nWhenever tokens are burned, an exit tax is enacted on liquidation. As members \"cash out\" and liquidate their funds, a small percentage of their returns are sent back into the funding pool, allowing for the simultaneous funding of the commons while contributors are earning returns. This means that the system always benefits - even if speculators are just looking to make a quick return.\n \n### References\n- https://hackernoon.com/what-are-bonding-curve-offerings-xi2k34bm\n- https://dev.to/ceonyema/bonding-curve-offering-an-efficient-and-transparent-funding-model-4oae\n- https://www.linumlabs.com/articles/bonding-curves-the-what-why-and-shapes-behind-it\n- https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/\n- https://medium.com/molecule-blog/designing-different-fundraising-scenarios-with-sigmoidal-token-bonding-curves-ceafc734ed97\n- https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8\n- https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751\n- https://medium.com/aventus/token-bonding-curves-683b8b309c18\n",

          "details": "Liquidity mining and yield farming are two terms that are often used interchangeably in DeFi. \n\nThere are currently more than 50 DEXs and 50 lending and borrowing protocols, but only a few of each have achieved significant adoption. These platforms face a chicken and an egg problem, i.e. the more liquidity (funds) they have, the better the trade will be, and the more users will come to their protocol, which will further increase the funds and liquidity on the protocol.\n\nNot just the amount of a crypto currently, but also the number of crypto currencies supported on a protocol also matters a lot. So to attract investors to bring money, most of these protocols offer rewards and share percentage of their fees. Rewards offered to the protocols are mostly the percentage of the trading fee and rewarding their native token. For example, 0x protocol offers ZRX tokens as rewards to its investors.\n\nIn the summer of 2020 and in 2021, we saw an influx of new projects offering investors and users huge rewards in order to attract them to their protocols. Most of these projects are in competition with one another, so investors have been able to take advantage of this by moving their funds around to different protocols and earning high rewards. As the rewards decreased or if another platform offered more attractive rewards, investors moved their funds again.\n\n## Drawbacks of Liquidity Mining\nThere are several drawbacks to attracting liquidity simply by giving native tokens in exchange:\n1. The liquidity providers are not motivated to help the protocol grow in the long term, so they may move to other protocols that offer better short-term rewards.\n2. By giving away native tokens, protocols increase the total supply of their tokens in the market, which can cause prices to drop.\n3. Even after providing heavy rewards, the investors remain in full control of the liquidity and can choose to leave the protocol at any time.\n\nThere are two common designs that different projects have adopted to combat this problem:\n\n1. **Protocol Owned Liquidity** - Using this protocols sell their native tokens in the form of bonds at a discounted price in exchange for the needed assets. Bonds generally have a maturity date or vesting schedule towards distribution of native tokens. This mechanism is covered in detail in one of the following chapters. \n\n2. **veToken Model** - The veToken Model is a way of distributing newly minted tokens to investors who buy the native token of the project and lock it up for a certain period of time. This act of locking up the token proves that the investor believes in the long term success of the protocol and shows their commitment to the project. This model was first introduced by Curve protocol."

          "details": "\n## Background\nMost enterprises need coverage for unforeseen events that could lead to financial losses, and this coverage is typically provided by insurance providers or investors. However, with the advent of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, it is now possible for anyone to stake/provide their funds to be used for the coverage of such losses. In return, the protocols usually reward these investors with either their native currency or some other form of compensation, in order to account for the risk they take by staking their funds.\n\n## What is Staking?\nStaking is the process of holding and locking up digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, as a means of providing security for a protocol. By staking their assets, investors can earn rewards in the form of new tokens, interest, or other incentives. The specifics of staking can differ depending on the protocol, but it is generally a way for users to earn a return on their crypto assets while supporting the project.\n\n## Examples\nFollowing are two of the many examples where protocols using staking mechanism to raise funds\n\n#### **Aave** \nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) is a Smart Contract-based component that allows Aave holders to lock their tokens. This locked AAVE will be used as a way to help mitigate any Shortfall Events that may occur within the money markets of the Aave ecosystem. A Shortfall Event is defined as a deficit, and the interpretation or occurrence of such an event is subject to Protocol Governance vote.\n\nIf a Shortfall Event occurs, part of the locked AAVE is auctioned off on the market to be sold in order to cover the deficit that occurred. The Safety Module has a built-in backstop mechanism in place to prevent an excess flow of AAVE into the open market, which would further reduce the value of AAVE. Participants who lock AAVE into the Safety Module are effectively accepting the possibility of a Shortfall Event occurring, in exchange for receiving rewards in the form of Safety Incentives.\n\n#### **Sherlock** \nWhen you stake USDC with Sherlock for a fixed term(6 months, 12 months etc.), you earn a market-leading APY in exchange for the risk that your funds could be used to pay out an exploit at a covered protocol. The APY for a staker is made up of three streams:\n1) Premiums from protocol customers\n2) Interest earned from depositing staker funds into yield strategies (Aave, Compound, etc.)\n3) Incentive rewards paid in SHER (Sherlock’s governance token)"

Borrowers issue bonds to raise money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of time.\n\nWhen you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when it \"matures,\" or comes due after a set period of time.\n\n### DeFi Bonds\nThere is a lot of difference between bonds in DeFi and traditional bonds, just like there is a lot of difference between tokens and stocks. In some cases, projects might just be using the name \"bond\" for particular offerings, but the mechanics can be totally different from traditional bonds.\n\nThere are a few common mechanics that we often see being used in bonds as a way for DeFi projects to raise capital, these include:\n\n1. **Exchange of Native Token**: In return for selling their native token, projects will ask for a stable token or one that is less volatile in exchange.\n2. **Discount on Tokens**: To make the bonds more appealing, projects will sell them at a \n3. **Protocol owned Liquidity**: This is often used when a project needs to gain access to various tokens that are utilized as part of the product. For instance, to demonstrate the full potential of a Decentralized Exchange or Lending & Borrowing, protocols require access to a great deal of liquidity of different tokens.\n4. **Secondary Markets**: Most of these bonds can be sold at a secondary market place, so the investor doesn't have to wait for the bond to mature.\n\nIn the next chapters, we will be looking at a couple of protocols that provides ability to create and sell bonds."

This system is designed to reduce the power of whales (large investors) and favor democracy over plutocracy (a form of government in which the wealthy rule).\n\nExample: If you raise a grant that gets $100 from 100 contributors, and I raise a grant that gets $100 from 1 contributor, despite both grants being donated $100, you will get 99% of the matching pool. This is a great mechanism because it is a collective intelligence mechanism that routes money to where the  “poor and the many” have an advantage over the rich and the few.\n\nYou may give \"only\" a dollar, but really you are part of building an aggregate signal of what public goods folks want to see funded. Problems like sybil attacks and the need to raise matching pool funds can be mitigated by using a one person: one vote identity style. \n\n## Retroactive Public Goods Funding \nOptimism is trying to do public goods funding retroactively by creating a committee of experts. They're taking revenue from the Optimism network and using it to pay the committee for their time researching which things in the past have delivered value to the ecosystem. The idea is that more talent will be directed toward developing public goods funding in the present based on the assurance that they will be rewarded for it in the future.\n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/giveth/coordination-mechanisms-notes-from-a-conversation-with-griff-green-kevin-owocki-af95f3e831b1\n- https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1220\n- https://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1680"

Here we try to touch upon some of the most important points\n\n## U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nIn the United States, cryptocurrencies have received a lot of attention from both federal and state governments. The SEC typically has authority over the issuance or resale of any security token or other digital asset that constitutes security.\n\nThe SEC has been unequivocal in its opinion that even if a token issued in an ICO has utility, the token will still be deemed a security that is subject to the Securities Act if it meets elements of the Howey test.\n\nSecurities such as stocks and debt instruments, and also investment contracts, are under the direction of the SEC. Derivatives such as futures and swaps pertaining to commodities are under the oversight of the CFTC, unless those commodities are securities.\n\nThe future of cryptocurrency regulation is still an open question.\n\n## Howey Test\nThe Howey Test is derived from a 1946 Supreme Court ruling in the case of the SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., which has been reaffirmed by the courts several times. Under the Howey Test, a transaction is considered a security if the following four criteria are met:\n- Money is invested.\n- There is an expectation the investor will earn a profit.\n- The investment is in a common enterprise.\n- Profits are generated via the efforts of others.\n\n## Notable Regulations\nSome of the most crucial legal frameworks that help you to fundraise from retail or private investors to offer you approval and remain compliant include the following.\n1. **Reg CF** - Reg CF permits non-accredited (retail) investors to purchase private companies up to a certain limit depending on either their net-worth or annual income, helping businesses raise up to $5 million per year.\n2. **Reg A** - Regulation A Tier 2 (the Mini-IPO/Reg A) is a less demanding variation of initial public offering (IPO). It's less regulated and can be used to raise up to $75 million every 12 months.

          "details": "### Introduction\nChicken bond is a novel bonding mechanism, which allows protocols to deepen the protocol owned liquidity at no cost while boosting yield opportunities for their end users. \n\nBond purchasers can buy bonds using a token (e.g. TNK). When the bond is purchased, it has zero bTokens. bTokens are self-accruing tokens, so their value keeps increasing. At a certain time in the future, the bond purchaser breaks even on their investment, i.e. the `price of bToken * quantity = price of TKN * quantity invested in bond`. The bTokens accrued over and above this point is the user's profit.\n\nAt any time, bond holders can either retrieve their principal foregoing the accrued amount (“chicken out”) or trade it in for the accrued bTKN (“chicken in”).\n\n\nThe yield amplification is achieved by directing additional yield from Protocol owned liquidity and users bonding underlying tokens (TKN) to newly issued \"boosted\" tokens (bTKN).\n\nTKN acquired by the system backs the bTKN supply: while a portion of the TKN in the treasury is directly redeemable by bTKN holders, another portion contributes permanently to the redeemable value through its yield. Along with the yield retained from pending bonds, bTKN benefits from a rapidly rising price floor, making it an attractive investment.\n"

          "details": "## Buckets\nThe protocol operates a Treasury that consists of three logical parts (“buckets”): Pending Bucket, Reserve Bucket and Permanent Bucket.\n\n#### Pending Bucket \nThe Pending Bucket contains the TKN that is still bonded by active users. This means that their deposits haven't been acquired by the protocol yet. Since bond holders may withdraw their bonded TKN at any time (chicken out), their deposits are considered as pending. The yield earned by the Pending Bucket is credited to the Reserve Bucket.\n\n#### Reserve Bucket\nThis graph contains data on the total amount of TKN that was relinquished by former bond holders after a \"chicken in\" event, as well as the yield of the Pending and Permanent buckets. The Reserve bucket directly backs the bTokens supply through the redemption mechanism.\n\n#### Permanent Bucket\nContains the other portion of the TKN relinquished by former bond holders. The yield earned by the Permanent Bucket is credited to the Reserve Bucket.\n\nHaving a Permanent Bucket can turn out as unnecessary or even detrimental for some use cases.\nAs an alternative, the protocol can thus be set up without a Permanent Bucket\n\n\n## Yield Amplification (bToken)\nThe Reserve Bucket not only earns a return on its own assets, but additionally receives\nthe returns from the Pending and the Permanent Buckets, achieving an amplified return.  This useful property is called yield amplification.\n\nAs the protocol doesn’t distribute any yields, but reinvests them inside the Reserve Bucket, the\nvalue of the Reserve Bucket grows over time even without the inflow of new capital. Due to the\nyield amplification, the Reserve Bucket grows faster than if the same funds were invested regularly\nwith a (compounding) rate of return.\n\n## Flow\nFirst, when a user bonds their tokens, the tokens are sent to the Pending bucket. Then, depending on whether the user chickens in, the \"chickened-in\" funds are sent to the other two buckets, Reserve and Permanent.\n\nThe tokens in the Reserve bucket are directly responsible for the backing of the generated bTokens, while the tokens in the Permanent bucket are permanently owned by the system and are used to generate yield to be funneled into the Reserve bucket. \n\n## Economics\nThe Boosted Token bTokens derives its value from the Reserve Bucket, as its direct backing, and the yield generated by the entire Treasury.\n\nSince the bTokens supply is redeemable for a proportional share of the acquired TKN, the market cap of bTokens should normally be worth at least the amount of TKN kept in the Reserve Bucket. This means that the redemption price pr will act as a price floor, below which arbitrage becomes possible.\n\nThis system is designed to protect investors by ensuring that the bToken always has a minimum value. \n"

          "details": "The Chicken Bond protocol is a way for projects to get Protocol Owned Liquidity without having to pay for it outright. \n\nThe way it works is by creating a 'flywheel effect' between bonding and bToken pricing. In other words, the more people bond, the more yield is retained for bToken holders. \n\nIf someone decides to chicken out and leave the system, the yield they would have earned from their TKN goes into the Reserve bucket. This increases rewards for others who stay in the system, and incentivizes them to continue participating.\n\nA higher yield makes bonding more attractive, because it increases the price premium over the underlying TKN. This provides the protocol with both permanent and redeemable TKN liquidity, which can be used for different needs based on the needs of the project.\n\n### Downsides\n1. Chicken bonds are a great financial instrument, but they can be overwhelming for new users.\n2. The system is dynamic, which means that people who bond early can sometimes get less rewards than those who join later."

          "details": "## What is Bond Protocol?\n\nBond Protocol (Olympus Pro) is a platform that allows any project to acquire liquidity for their DAO or protocol by selling bonds. Bond Protocol is, at its core, a service for protocols wishing to use bonds in their emissions programmes with minimal overhead and maximum impact. They give infrastructure, experience, and exposure to partners. Projects need only bring a token and a goal.\n\n## Protocol Owned Liquidity\nProtocols can accumulate the critical infrastructural liquidity that they typically service through liquidity mining through bonds. Instead of renting that liquidity (sometimes with unstainable emissions), they simply buy it, transforming a value-draining permanent expense into revenue-generating assets that enable the rest of the platform's functioning. This is a significant change from the traditional way of liquidity mining, where projects rent liquidity with rewards.\n\n ![Flow of funds in traditional model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/flow_of_funds_in_traditional_model.png) `Reference: https://docs.bondprotocol.finance/`\n\nIn the earlier DeFi model, projects pay tokens from their treasury over a set period of time to rent liquidity and the attention of liquidity providers (LPs). Often, when these rewards end, LPs simply move on to the next farm, making the liquidity mining event a sunk cost with little to show for. With Bond Protocol, projects can make the flow of funds circular and create a symbiotic relationship with profit seekers and their community alike. As projects use the bonding mechanism to improve their liquidity, that liquidity makes its way back to the project's treasury and becomes a permanent, income-producing asset. In other words, liquidity mining through Bond Protocol is no longer a sunk cost, and the project now has full control over the liquidity they paid for.\n\n![Flow of funds using bonding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/flow_of_funds_using_bonding.png) `Reference: https://docs.bondprotocol.finance/`\n\nBy flipping the traditional model on its head, projects not only benefit, but so do their communities. Community members can rest easy knowing that the liquidity for the token they support won't disappear overnight when incentives dry up. They'll also be much happier knowing that the project is receiving an income-producing asset in return for token rewards rather than renting mercenaries. These two major improvements create a much healthier ecosystem around each token and allow young projects to thrive.\n",

          "details": "Bonding is a process in which a user can sell an asset, such as a Quote Token, in a bond market created by an issuer, in exchange for a discounted Payout Token at a later date. To encourage users to sell to the protocol rather than the open market, bonds are offered at a discounted rate, and they also have a vesting period to prevent users from selling all the discounted tokens at once for a quick profit.\n\nA continuous [Dutch auction](https://medium.com/@Bond_Protocol/auctions-what-the-dutch-80e4bb3ee7ad) is used to price the bonds, and the price is determined by the supply and demand of bonds in the market. The bond price goes up when there is more demand, and goes down when there is less demand. This mechanism provides a real-time reflection of the bond price in the market. As a result, bonding is a highly competitive space, with participants competing to get the largest discount.\n\nBelow image is a good visualization of how it works: \n\n![Dutch Auction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/dutch_auction.png) `Reference: https://medium.com/@Bond_Protocol/auctions-what-the-dutch-80e4bb3ee7ad`\n\n## Benefits of Bonding\nThere are several benefits of bonding, such as allowing a protocol to accumulate their own liquidity. \n\nProtocol Owned Liquidity (POL) allows a protocols to attain sufficient liquidity for normal market operations. Without POL and relying on external liquidity providers, in distress market conditions, liquidity is often pulled from the protocol, exacerbating the situation with less exit liquidity (liquidity death spiral).\n\nAnother benefit is that POL transforms liquidity from a liability to a revenue source. Every swap transaction in a pool contributes a 0.3%/0.25% (Uniswap/Sushiswap) fee to the LPs. With POL, as liquidity is permanently locked in the treasury, these fees provide a constant source of revenue for the protocol. \n\nAdditionally, POL allows for additional yield farming opportunities, such as the Onsen program offered by Sushiswap, where protocols can have their liquidity pair listed for SUSHI rewards. Once successfully listed, the protocols can deposit their SLP tokens into the Onsen menu and farm SUSHI tokens.\n\nThere is one additional benefit for community members i.e. an opportunity to acquire the protocol's token at a discount\n",

          "details": "### Advantages of Bond Protocol\n-  **Increase project runway, reduce insolvency risks**: Most protocols are over-exposed to their native governance token, with most treasuries having <10% diversification. Issuing bonds allows funds for development and investment in strategic initiatives to increase protocol viability and longevity. \n\n- **Acquire liquidity at lower long-term cost**: Protocols pay a lot to rent liquidity via inflationary incentives paid in their native governance token. High incentives paid to mercenary capital can create negative feedback loops that destroy value for the protocol and token holders. \n\n- **Permissionless**: Anyone can create a bond market! Bond Protocol is self-contained and trustless, just like you would expect from a DeFi protocol. When you launch a bond on our marketplace, you are in complete control. You can choose to receive and bond any ERC20 token, including base assets and LP tokens. The vesting period, bond capacity, and market duration can be tuned to suit your protocol’s needs. \n\n- **Composable**: Bond purchasers receive Bond Tokens (tokenized bonds) that represent their positions which allow for the creation of secondary markets. With the introduction of tokenized bonds, a new range of opportunities is unlocked in DeFi. Bonds can be used as collateral, exchanged between wallets, or even used in governance.  \n\n- **Modular**: Bond Protocol's contract architecture makes it easy to add new bond assets and auction interfaces. Protocols will be able to select from a variety of bond markets that best suit their unique attributes. Initially launched with two types of bond vesting, Fixed-Term (ERC1155) and Fixed-Expiry (ERC20). Fixed-Term bonds are most similar to classic Olympus bonds, with their maturity set a fixed number of days from purchase (ex: 14 days). With Fixed-Expiry bonds, on the other hand, all bonds issued from that market mature on a specific date (ex: Dec-31).\n",

          "explanation": "Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) allows a protocol to provide guarantees to users that there is always sufficient liquidity for normal market operations. Without POL and relying on external liquidity providers, in distress market conditions, liquidity is often pulled from the protocol, exacerbating the situation with less exit liquidity (liquidity death spiral). Another benefit is that POL transforms liquidity from a liability to a revenue source. Every swap transaction in a pool contributes a 0.3%/0.25% (Uniswap/Sushiswap) fee to the LPs. With POL, as liquidity is permanently locked in the treasury, these fees provide a constant source of revenue for the protocol. Additionally, POL allows for additional yield farming opportunities, such as the Onsen program offered by Sushiswap, where protocols can have their liquidity pair listed for SUSHI rewards. Once successfully listed, the protocols can deposit their SLP tokens into the Onsen menu and farm SUSHI tokens.",

It empowers project teams to generate liquidity directly through community participation. The creators of Fjord Foundry believe in a world where decentralized, permissionless engagement creates the ideal conditions for bold ideas to thrive and gives individuals and communities the power to shape the future they want to see.\n\nFjord Foundry specializes in Fair Launch Auctions (FLAs) - a crowdfunding mechanism that enables projects and ideas from around the world to raise money from individuals without any barriers to entry. The platform is designed to make it easy for users to create and use Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) through its intuitive and user-friendly website. The main concept of Fjord Foundry is to allow for the distribution of tokens and NFTs with a transparent, open, and fair price discovery mechanism. The platform has a long-standing reputation in the industry, which has led to an [exclusive collaboration agreement](https://snapshot.org/#/balancer.eth/proposal/0xcc065f373e15a264e1647bc794a4a83039fc4d377a69875ec828eb0148faa4ba) between the Balancer DAO and Fjord Foundry. This agreement allows Fjord Foundry to offer the most cutting-edge and efficient LBP technology to its users.\n\n#### Why Choose Fjord?\n\nFjord Foundry is a community platform that offers several advantages over other platforms. \n\n- **Sniper Bots**  One of the key advantages of Fjord Foundry is its resistance to sniper bots. On other platforms, the token or NFT launch process is often gamed by experienced developers who use bots specifically designed to detect when a new token or NFT is listed, allowing them to scoop up all of the supply before anyone else even has a chance. However, Fjord Foundry has implemented a built-in high-low price discovery mechanism, which makes it resistant to sniper bots. This allows users to join in whenever they feel the price is fair.\n- **Providing Equal Opportunity**  Another advantage of Fjord Foundry is its provision of equal opportunity. On Fjord Foundry, whales, VCs, and other large players are unable to game the start of liquidity bootstrapping pools (LBPs), which means the average person is given the opportunity to participate in these opportunities without worrying about asymmetric information that can affect launch events. The platform provides open and transparent token and NFT LBPs, with all the information users need right in front of them.\n- **Sustainable Communities**  Fjord Foundry also promotes sustainable communities by deterring sniper bots and allowing communities equal opportunity to participate in token and NFT launch events. This fosters a sense of trust and ownership among community members, which can encourage greater community involvement and more engaged communities over the long term.\n- **Price Discovery**  Fjord Foundry's LBP's allow for price discovery, as the price of the token starts high and drops over time based on a pre-configured price decay curve. This can be resisted by buying pressure from participants, and anyone can buy into or sell out of the LBP freely at any time, so the price truly regulates itself.\n- **Proven Track Record**  Fjord Foundry has a proven track record of hosting the highest volume and enabling teams to bootstrap the highest amount when compared to other comparable platforms, by a significant margin. The platform encourages wider community participation, and users do not need to rely on traditional funding methods to build their ideas.\n"

          "shortTitle": "LBP",
          "details": "### What is a Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool?\n\nA Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) is a specific configuration of [Balancer's Liquidity Pools](https://docs.balancer.fi/products/balancer-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-lbps). LBPs are primarily used to distribute digital tokens using a fair, open, and transparent price discovery mechanism.\n\nLiquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) are just smart pools that can change token weighting dynamically (for example, 1/99 to 99/1 for TokenA/TokenB). [Weighted Math](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/math/weighted-math) along with time-dependent weights is used by LBPs. The pool owner, who also has the ability to pause exchanges, chooses the starting and ending weights and timings.\n\nConsider the beginning price of your LBP to be the ceiling you wish to set for the token sale. This may appear contradictory, but because LBPs operate differently than other token sales, your starting price should be significantly higher than what you believe to be the reasonable price. This does not imply that you are attempting to sell the token for more than it is worth. Setting a high initial price allows the changing pool weights of your LBP to fully effect the price, gradually dropping it until market equilibrium is established. Unlike previous token sale methods, such as bonding curves, consumers are disincentivized to buy early and instead gain from waiting for the price to fall until it hits a level they consider fair.\n\nBelow image gives nice visualization of how the price discovery curve varies with start and end weights.\n\nBut having said that, price does not always keep decreasing as it not only depends on the weights but also takes the demand into consideration. Thus the price can also increase if there is an increased demand. [Here](https://fjordfoundry.com/pools/mainnet/0xCe7B614d4898125a6B0D398AF3A8A7EB318416A0) is an example:\n\n[Here](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/a-primer-on-fair-token-launches-and-liquidity-bootstrapping-pools-11bab5ff33a2) is a primer on fair token launches and liquidity bootstrapping pools if you want to dive deeper.\n\nYou can also follow the steps [here](https://help.fjordfoundry.com/fjord-foundry-docs/for-lbp-hosts/how-to-create-an-lbp) to create an LBP yourself.\n\nBelow is a visual representation of the pool weight distribution shifting:\n\n#### Key Features\n\n* **Price discovery** - One of the key features of LBPs is the mechanism of price discovery. The price of the token starts high and drops based on a pre-configured price decay curve. This process can be resisted by buying pressure from LBP participants, and anyone can buy into or sell out of the LBP freely at any time, so the price truly regulates itself.\n\n* **Permissionless participation** - Another feature of LBPs is open and permissionless participation. Unlike other platforms, LBPs do not require whitelists, hard caps, or listing requirements. There is no minimum or maximum allocation and LBP participants are free to choose how much they want to buy.\n\n* **Fair distribution** - LBPs also promote fair distribution of tokens, flipping the first-come-first-serve launch model on its head. This ensures that it's no longer a race where the first bot in or the transaction with the highest gas fee wins. It allows for getting tokens into the hands of as many people as possible in a fair way that disincentives front-runners and whales from getting better rates than smaller participants.\n\n* **Capital efficiency** - Lastly, LBPs provide capital efficiency, as The initial value of the project's token in LBP can be multiplied by up to 99 times in relation to the collateral put with it. Furthermore, unless the project's tokens already exist outside of the LBP, the collateral can be fully reclaimed at the end of the LBP, in which case someone may choose to sell into the LBP.\n"

          "shortTitle": "Token divestments",
          "details": "### How does Fjord support token divestments via LBPs?\n\nFjord can support sustainable token divestment of token assets for projects and DAOs that hold the tokens of another project in their treasury via a partnership or agreement. It is common for there to be donations made of tokens to a particular charity or group or a need to generate liquidity for tokens held in the treasury. However, it can be challenging to divest these tokens without harming the market and/or community for that token. Additionally, it can be time-consuming to constantly undertake this process.\n\nMany projects have given large portions of tokens to well-known groups and figureheads. For example, Vitalik Buterin received trillions of Shiba Inu tokens while Gitcoin also received trillions of Akita Inu tokens via Vitalik ($5 million USD in value). The Gitcoin community was left with the question of what was the most efficient, fair, and appropriate way to maximize the sale value of the tokens while not causing an immediate and negative impact to the token price and the AKITA community.\n\nThe answer for Gitcoin was a Balancer Liquidity Bootstrapping (LBP) Pool created and hosted by Fjord Foundry. The price decay mechanics of an LBP allow for true price discovery, and for price decay to occur via weighted pools over a time duration that can be customized to the LBP owner's choosing. In the instance of Gitcoin, the LBP was scheduled over a period of 365 days, ensuring a supply shock did not instantly crash the price of the token.\n\nAdditionally, the Fjord platform allows for both buying and selling of AKITA, so the price is able to generally keep equilibrium with the current market price available on alternative exchanges, with some savvy traders able to take quick advantage of any arbitrage opportunities that may arise from any price discrepancies. Due to the slow price decay over a long time horizon and the arbitrage opportunity, the main token of the LBP, in this case AKITA, is slowly absorbed by the overall crypto market in exchange for WETH without a drastic impact to AKITA price.\n"

          "key": "redemption-pools",
          "title": "What are Redemption Pools?",
          "shortTitle": "Redemption Pools",
          "details": "### What are Redemption Pools?\n\nThese are special pools that allow projects to progressively distribute a token over a defined time period in exchange for a specified base token (In some cases this could be releasing a governance token in exchange for LP). During the Redemption Pool period, users can exchange the base token for the project's token, which contributes to the collective decision of the asset's fair value.\n\nPreviously, only particular base tokens (USDC, DAI, ETH, WETH) were available as assets for projects to accumulate via standard [Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBPs) on Fjord](https://help.fjordfoundry.com/fjord-foundry-docs/welcome-info/welcome-to-fjord-foundry), however redemption pools let any asset to be designated for that role. \n\n#### Protocol Owned Liquidity via Redemption Pools\n\nA protocol may desire to acquire POL from an audience that is optimistic on the protocol and wants to be more involved in it (among other things) in exchange for a reduced governance token. The protocol can set up a Redemption Pool on Fjord, which not only allows for the above distribution but also allows protocol members to collectively choose the discount of the governance token compared to the liquidity they provide to the protocol.\n\nThis form of governance token distribution allows the project to progressively distribute their token while acquiring more control over their liquidity.Furthermore, the extended time horizon for token distribution, as opposed to distributing over a condensed time period, allows a project to reduce point in time risk and provides greater flexibility to adjust the governance token distribution rate.\n\nRedemption Pools can also be carried out in a sequential manner based on the needs of the project and do not have to be a single event. Sequentially launching Redemption Pools allows teams to tune the pool's weights and other factors as needed to support the continuing distribution of their token while also ensuring the discount rate falls within the intended target.\n\n#### Token Buybacks via Redemption Pools\n\nToken buybacks via redemption pools can be a powerful tool for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and projects to support the price of their native token during volatile market conditions. Redemption pools allow for efficient buybacks by providing a mechanism for the treasury to purchase its own tokens with reduced volatility, while also maximizing the number of tokens that are returned to the treasury.\n\nWhen undertaking token buybacks via traditional automated market maker (AMM) models, treasuries may not be realizing the full potential of their buyback efforts. They may need to buy their token at a higher price, which can lead to a short-term spike in the token's value. However, this also means that fewer tokens are returned to the treasury, which can have a negative long-term impact on the price of the token. As a result, the overall impact of the buyback may not be as effective as it could have been, with less value accrued by the treasury in terms of quantity of tokens.\n\nConversely, undertaking a treasury buyback via Fjord's weighted liquidity pools allows projects to accumulate governance tokens back to the treasury in a slow and steady manner. The use of weighted pools enables a reduced market impact, leading to a higher accrual of tokens, less tokens on the market, and an improved composition of the treasury. This approach can help to ensure that token buybacks are effective in supporting the price of the token over the long term, by taking a more sustainable approach to removing tokens from circulation.\n"

It is built as an open-source tool operated on smart contracts where anyone can access it and build on its infrastructure to create new solutions. As a security token, Polymenth is powered by ERC1400 which is the standard for regulated assets living on the Blockchain. This way investors can be whitelisted, Know Your Customer (KYC) processes can be initiated easily to know who owns what, limits on transitions can be set, and so on.\n\nPolymath is built on the Polymesh blockchain which is a specific protocol built for handling security tokens. It is able to manage certain functions such as compliance, identity, confidentiality, and governance which other blockchains may not be able to cover in full. Polymesh is operated on the ERC 1400 (an Ethereum-based standard for security tokens). \n\nSince 2017, Polymath has continuously strived to work with the Blockchain ecosystem to come up with a system that works for all. With the advanced technology that has been built by Polymath, issuers can automate their flows and state the rules about who can access or hold their tokens, what locations the tokens can be accessed from, how they can be transferred, the requirements for holding the tokens, etc. It is also highly customizable as you can create your offer, set up your yield strategy, issue tokens, manage your team of experts, attract investors to your business, manage current and future portfolios, and access to key players in the ecosystem while positioning your business for massive growth.\n\nAs a major player in the industry, Polymath has developed products that will cater to the needs of anyone who wants to build solutions that will digitize their real-world assets. With use cases such as effective asset onboarding, compliance assurance, transfer restrictions, redundant data, source insight, transfer disable functions, asset recovery, and identity verification, and with a deeply technical team focused on making the process simpler and easier, Polymath is powering the future of security tokens",

At the advent of Polymath, smart contracts were launched on a general blockchain, Ethereum, to build a token that will digitize physical assets. These tokens would serve as security tokens such that people who own physical assets in real life, can have a digital token to prove ownership of such assets. These tokens can then be traded in the primary and secondary markets thereby transferring ownership of not just the token but also the assets. \n\nHowever, there are many challenges surrounding the ERC20 protocol that was to be used that would make it not suitable for security tokens. Some of those challenges include anonymity since people can trade tokens without necessarily verifying their identities so this could easily create a loophole for theft. Also, these assets sit on regulated markets but the core ERC20 protocol was built for an unregulated environment so there is almost no way to enforce compliance with procedures and basic requirements for trading securities on the Blockchain.\n\nThese and many more issues created an opportunity for a new protocol and a new network, hence Polymath going ahead to build the Polymesh network specifically for security tokens, backed by the ERC 1400 protocol which was also created for securities. Polymesh, therefore, was built on the parity substrate framework because of its novel technology, product roadmap and fit with what Ploymath is building, community and a number of other factors some of which include:\n\n* Modularity: Polymath operates a modular structure as a part of its infrastructure where new rules and features can be added to the network easily by creating new modules while maintaining an interoperable library of the ERC 1400 protocol where people can use only parts of the protocol that makes sense to them. Substrate also operates a similar model thereby making a seamless integration possible. It has a library of modules for functions such as finality, block production, balance management, governance features, and support for smart contracts.\n* Future-Proof Technology: The major parts of the Substrate infrastructure are built on Rust; a language known for high performance, low runtime size, and optimized for memory safety guarantees. It is also built on industry standards such as LibP2P and WASM which are slowly being adopted by other Blockchains like Ethereum.\n* Governance and Upgrades: Polymesh being a blockchain built for a specific purpose, needed to run on a framework that gives it the flexibility it needed to provide all necessary requirements. Substrate provides a forkless upgrade mechanism such that the process of upgrading the software is done seamlessly. \n* Community: Polymath has a large number of people building various solutions on their infrastructure and Substrate also has a great community of developers that make the work seamless. So, there is a symbiotic relationship between the two as Ploymesh can easily leverage the Substrate community when releasing features or marketing their products.",

          "details": "The Polymath Capital Platform is an all-inclusive platform built on the Polymesh blockchain to power the process of raising funds for real-world projects or getting investments on a real-world asset by providing security tokens to people who invest in these assets or projects. It is designed to work for everyone, whether you are an investment advisor, an investor, or an asset owner. It is one of the most robust systems to provide this service to people. What makes this really interesting is that it is operated on the Blockchain which is a transparent and decentralized network for anyone to be a part of.\n\nAsset owners can easily create and issue tokens, create a yield amount for investments made, create a capitalization table to know what all investors own, apply KYC/KYB restrictions where necessary, and get team members onboarded on the Ploymath Capital Platform. Investors can as well get invited to invest or be able to browse through various investments to know which fit them based on the jurisdiction, yield, KYC, and any other constraint that might be placed on investment while advisors can generally have access to information if the team has that function from the get-go. They can have information on cap tables, tokens created, and any other documentation or process created in the team.\n\nAs an end-to-end platform, Polymath provides not just tools for fundraising but for investor management throughout the lifecycle of the investment. Everything needed to manage the process is already included in the software. Some of the core features highlighted are:\n\n* Cap Table Management\n* Corporate Governance\n* Onboarding\n* Investors’ Accreditation\n* Custody\n* Investment Offerings\n\nBuilding for regulated markets definitely has a lot of challenges and this is why Polymath is committed to making the process of securitizing physical assets via tokens operated on the blockchain seamless. \n",

          "details": "The Polymath token studio is the platform where issuers can create security tokens either on the Polymesh network or on Ethereum. The process of creating these tokens starts with reservation, which is a 60-day period where a security token ticker symbol can be locked before opening it up to the public. For example, if GMT is a ticker symbol that is available on Polymesh, an issuer can reserve GMT for a period of 60 days within which the token must be created and if after that period the token is not created, then GMT is made available for the public to use. Reserving a token on Polymath costs 500 POLYX.\n\nBefore the minting process can begin, the issuer needs to firstly assemble the team that will provide the base requirements for the token to be created. This team can be a combination of Legal Firms, Deal Brokers, KYC providers, and a network of custody agents among others.\n\nOnce the issuer is ready to mint the security token, 2500 POLYX is required to sign the transaction so that the token will go live. After that process is completed then the compliance rules of the token can be set so that people who will own the token will be bound by those rules. The last process is then to distribute the token.\n\nWhen Polymath was first launched on Ethereum, it created the POLY token which is an ERC20 token. However, when it moved to Polymesh which is its own Blockchain network, it changed its token to POLYX. Issuers who owned POLY and wish to change them to POLYX so as to use the Polymesh blockchain can do so by following the steps in the video below:\n\n[![POLY to POLYX Upgrade Bridge](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zZetUxboCSI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZetUxboCSI)\n\nIn order to know how to mint a security token on the Polymesh network, watch the video below:\n\n[![Token Studio on Polymesh](https://img.youtube.com/vi/TGDBulqZUM0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGDBulqZUM0)\n\nAlso, Polymath supports the minting of security tokens that operate on the Ethereum Blockchain to enable people who want to use a general-purpose blockchain network.
