          "details": "## Traditional Fundraising\nTraditional methods of fundraising can be quite limiting and outdated, often not taking into consideration new techniques that could make the project more appealing to not just venture capitalists, but to the community or customers as well. Some limitations of existing fundraising methods include:\n\n- Projects that speak VC-friendly language can easily raise funds, limiting access for first time founders or creators. \n- The process can be time-consuming and frustrating, often requiring a lot of upfront work with no guarantee of success. \n- Price is set by the founders or VCs, without any price discovery. \n- Most investment opportunities are only available to accredited investors, i.e. people earning more than $200,000 (or a few other constraints)\n\n## DeFi Fundraising\nIn DeFi projects, one or more tokens can be issued and then sold by the project using some of the fundraising primitives that have been developed in the ecosystem.  One thing to note is that many of the projects in Crypto might not adhere to security laws (selling of the shares/stocks in open market) and it is very important to do your proper research before you decide to use one of the DeFi primitives for fundraising. The most common DeFi primitives for fundraising currently used are:\n1. **Bonding Curves** - Bootstrapping funds with earlier investors being rewarded more lucrative than those who join the project later on.\n2. **Liquidity Mining/Yield Farming** - Offering native tokens to investors in exchange for providing liquidity to the protocol which can be used for trading, lending, or borrowing. This structure allows investors to have nearly full control over the funds and they can choose to exit the position when desired.\n3. **Staking** - Staking allows investors to deposit their funds with a protocol and earn interest on them. In the event of an unexpected loss of funds, some money may be deducted from the deposited funds. \n4. **DeFi Bonds** - DeFi bonds are an innovative mechanism that allows investors to purchase tokens at a discount. Investors purchase the bonds and then get access to the tokens once the bond matures.\n5. **Quadratic Funding** - In this crowdfunding method, money from a central matching pool is allocated based on which projects are more democratically supported as opposed to those into which more capital goes.\n\nWe will cover each of these funding methods in the following sections. \n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/giveth/the-commons-stack-scaling-the-commons-to-re-prioritize-people-and-the-planet-fdc076aec4eb\n- https://medium.com/giveth/blockchain-economies-and-the-commons-cdb67dd1a163",

          "details": "### What is a Bonding Curve?\n\nThe Bonding Curves Offerings (BCO) provides a way for projects to efficiently, fairly, and reliably distribute tokens to project adopters in a transparent way. \n\nA bonding curve is a mathematical curve that defines the relationship between price and token supply. In other words, it's a way to visualize how the price of a token changes as more tokens are minted. Here's an example of a bonding curve, where `currentPrice = tokenSupplyÂ²`:\n\n\n<img style=\"max-height:300px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/simple_bonding_curve.png\" />\n\n`Source: https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/`\n\nThe Bonding Curve explains how the price of a token is determined by the number of tokens that have already been minted. In the case of an exponential curve, such as the one shown in the example, the growth rate will speed up as the number of tokens minted increases.\n\nWhen someone buys a token, each successive buyer will need to pay a slightly higher price per token, which could generate profits for the earliest investors. As more people learn about the project and buying continues, the value of each token will go up slowly along the bonding curve. As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, there is a price advantage for early adopters. Early buyers have a considerable upside potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low as well.\n\nEarly buyers of tokens have a considerable upside potential when compared with later entrants to market, as prices are lowest when supply is low. As tokens have the lowest price at the lowest part of the curve, early adopters can benefit from a price advantage. By getting in early, buyers can take advantage of the potential for growth as prices increase as more people enter the market.\n\nThe most significant advantage that Bonding Curves have over traditional asset pricing methods is the fact that the pricing of assets is transparent, set in stone(on-chain), and unchanging at all points. The market is able to reach a collective agreement through well-defined rules, without needing outside intervention. Because the cost per token is decided by the curve/formula, every person involved knows how much each token will cost ahead of time. This allows for a honest and just market where everyone knows the score.\n\n### Buying/Minting tokens from bonding curve:\n- A bonding curve smart contract is created that allows users to buy/mint a new token (eg. Bonding Curve Token, ABC) with by supplying a currency for example USDC.\n- The price of ABC is algorithmically calculated in relation to its current circulating supply and shown in its reserve currency, USDC.\n- By providing USDC to the contract, the user can buy the new ABC token through a smart contract. \n- After the user completes their purchase, the price of the token will move along the bonding curve in relation to the amount of supply the user has just minted (likely moving the price up for future buyers)\n- A ABC holder can choose to burn or sell their token back to the curve at any time. If the price of the token goes up after they purchase it, they will likely sell it at a profit (minus gas and fees). They will receive the bonded USDC back from the smart contract after their sell is approved.\n\n\n### Key benefits of bonding curves:\n- Limitless Supply - Normally there is no limit to the number of tokens that can be minted.\n- Deterministic Price Calculation - The price of the tokens increases and decreases according to the number of tokens minted.\n- Continuous Price - The price of token n is less than token n+1 and more than token n-1.\n- Immediate Liquidity - Tokens can be bought or sold instantaneously at any time.\n\n### Limitations\n* Basic forms of bonding curves don't keep a minimal reserve that might be needed to bootstrap the project.\n* Users can buy or sell the tokens to the bonding curve, but minting of new tokens based on time schedule is not possible. This could be an issue for new projects that need to compensate for an initial burn rate.\n\n### Augmented Bonding Curves\nThe most basic form of a bonding curve is \"x = y.\" By adding more variables or constraints to the formula, you can make the bonding curve more suitable to the needs of your project. The Augmented Bonding Curve, explained below, is one such example of how bonding curves can be extended.\n\nThe Augmented Bonding Curve design can be conceptualized as a typical bonding curve with the addition of a funding pool, a token lock-up/vesting mechanism, and inter-system feedback loops. The system is launched in two stages: the Hatch Phase and the Open Phase.\n\n<img style=\"max-height:600px\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DoDAO-io/raising-funds-using-defi/main/images/augmented_bonding_curve.png\" />\n\n`Source: https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751`\n\nThe Hatch Phase is designed to allow initial contributors (founding members, devoted contributors, initial investors, etc.) to participate in a hatch sale. The purpose of this phase is to gather contributors and pool capital. A percentage of the capital is put into the Reserve Pool and used to mint tokens and determine the initial spot price during the Open Phase. The remaining capital in the Funding Pool is un-bonded and can be distributed as real capital outside of the bonding curve.\n\nIn a typical bonding curve system, the tokens can be burned at any time. However, in an augmented bonding curve system, the tokens minted during the Hatch Phase are locked and cannot be burned. This is to prevent any early speculation or arbitrage that could affect the stability of the Reserve Pool. It's important to have funds locked early on in the system to make sure that the capital in the Funding Pool is allocated to community initiatives, research projects and development milestones that will help the commons grow.\n\nOnce the goal for the Hatch Sale is reached, the new tokens go into a reserve pool where they can be bought or sold according to the bonding curve. The Hatchers tokens are gradually unlocked through this vesting process.\n\nWhenever tokens are burned, an exit tax is enacted on liquidation. As members \"cash out\" and liquidate their funds, a small percentage of their returns are sent back into the funding pool, allowing for the simultaneous funding of the commons while contributors are earning returns. This means that the system always benefits - even if speculators are just looking to make a quick return.\n \n### References\n- https://hackernoon.com/what-are-bonding-curve-offerings-xi2k34bm\n- https://dev.to/ceonyema/bonding-curve-offering-an-efficient-and-transparent-funding-model-4oae\n- https://www.linumlabs.com/articles/bonding-curves-the-what-why-and-shapes-behind-it\n- https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves/\n- https://medium.com/molecule-blog/designing-different-fundraising-scenarios-with-sigmoidal-token-bonding-curves-ceafc734ed97\n- https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8\n- https://medium.com/giveth/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-3f1f7c1fa751\n- https://medium.com/aventus/token-bonding-curves-683b8b309c18\n",

          "details": "Liquidity mining and yield farming are two terms that are often used interchangeably in DeFi. \n\nThere are currently more than 50 DEXs and 50 lending and borrowing protocols, but only a few of each have achieved significant adoption. These platforms face a chicken and an egg problem, i.e. the more liquidity (funds) they have, the better the trade will be, and the more users will come to their protocol, which will further increase the funds and liquidity on the protocol.\n\nNot just the amount of a crypto currently, but also the number of crypto currencies supported on a protocol also matters a lot. So to attract investors to bring money, most of these protocols offer rewards and share percentage of their fees. Rewards offered to the protocols are mostly the percentage of the trading fee and rewarding their native token. For example, 0x protocol offers ZRX tokens as rewards to its investors.\n\nIn the summer of 2020 and in 2021, we saw an influx of new projects offering investors and users huge rewards in order to attract them to their protocols. Most of these projects are in competition with one another, so investors have been able to take advantage of this by moving their funds around to different protocols and earning high rewards. As the rewards decreased or if another platform offered more attractive rewards, investors moved their funds again.\n\n## Drawbacks of Liquidity Mining\nThere are several drawbacks to attracting liquidity simply by giving native tokens in exchange:\n1. The liquidity providers are not motivated to help the protocol grow in the long term, so they may move to other protocols that offer better short-term rewards.\n2. By giving away native tokens, protocols increase the total supply of their tokens in the market, which can cause prices to drop.\n3. Even after providing heavy rewards, the investors remain in full control of the liquidity and can choose to leave the protocol at any time.\n\nThere are two common designs that different projects have adopted to combat this problem:\n\n1. **Protocol Owned Liquidity** - Using this protocols sell their native tokens in the form of bonds at a discounted price in exchange for the needed assets. Bonds generally have a maturity date or vesting schedule towards distribution of native tokens. This mechanism is covered in detail in one of the following chapters. \n\n2. **veToken Model** - The veToken Model is a way of distributing newly minted tokens to investors who buy the native token of the project and lock it up for a certain period of time. This act of locking up the token proves that the investor believes in the long term success of the protocol and shows their commitment to the project. This model was first introduced by Curve protocol.",

          "details": "\n## Background\nMost enterprises need coverage for unforeseen events that could lead to financial losses, and this coverage is typically provided by insurance providers or investors. However, with the advent of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, it is now possible for anyone to stake/provide their funds to be used for the coverage of such losses. In return, the protocols usually reward these investors with either their native currency or some other form of compensation, in order to account for the risk they take by staking their funds.\n\n## What is Staking?\nStaking is the process of holding and locking up digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, as a means of providing security for a protocol. By staking their assets, investors can earn rewards in the form of new tokens, interest, or other incentives. The specifics of staking can differ depending on the protocol, but it is generally a way for users to earn a return on their crypto assets while supporting the project.\n\n## Examples\nFollowing are two of the many examples where protocols using staking mechanism to raise funds\n\n#### **Aave** \nThe Aave Safety Module (SM) is a Smart Contract-based component that allows Aave holders to lock their tokens. This locked AAVE will be used as a way to help mitigate any Shortfall Events that may occur within the money markets of the Aave ecosystem. A Shortfall Event is defined as a deficit, and the interpretation or occurrence of such an event is subject to Protocol Governance vote.\n\nIf a Shortfall Event occurs, part of the locked AAVE is auctioned off on the market to be sold in order to cover the deficit that occurred. The Safety Module has a built-in backstop mechanism in place to prevent an excess flow of AAVE into the open market, which would further reduce the value of AAVE. Participants who lock AAVE into the Safety Module are effectively accepting the possibility of a Shortfall Event occurring, in exchange for receiving rewards in the form of Safety Incentives.\n\n#### **Sherlock** \nWhen you stake USDC with Sherlock for a fixed term(6 months, 12 months etc.), you earn a market-leading APY in exchange for the risk that your funds could be used to pay out an exploit at a covered protocol. The APY for a staker is made up of three streams:\n1) Premiums from protocol customers\n2) Interest earned from depositing staker funds into yield strategies (Aave, Compound, etc.)\n3) Incentive rewards paid in SHER (Sherlockâs governance token)",

Borrowers issue bonds to raise money from investors willing to lend them money for a certain amount of time.\n\nWhen you buy a bond, you are lending to the issuer, which may be a government, municipality, or corporation. In return, the issuer promises to pay you a specified rate of interest during the life of the bond and to repay the principal, also known as face value or par value of the bond, when it \"matures,\" or comes due after a set period of time.\n\n### DeFi Bonds\nThere is a lot of difference between bonds in DeFi and traditional bonds, just like there is a lot of difference between tokens and stocks. In some cases, projects might just be using the name \"bond\" for particular offerings, but the mechanics can be totally different from traditional bonds.\n\nThere are a few common mechanics that we often see being used in bonds as a way for DeFi projects to raise capital, these include:\n\n1. **Exchange of Native Token**: In return for selling their native token, projects will ask for a stable token or one that is less volatile in exchange.\n2. **Discount on Tokens**: To make the bonds more appealing, projects will sell them at a \n3. **Protocol owned Liquidity**: This is often used when a project needs to gain access to various tokens that are utilized as part of the product. For instance, to demonstrate the full potential of a Decentralized Exchange or Lending & Borrowing, protocols require access to a great deal of liquidity of different tokens.\n4. **Secondary Markets**: Most of these bonds can be sold at a secondary market place, so the investor doesn't have to wait for the bond to mature.\n\nIn the next chapters, we will be looking at a couple of protocols that provides ability to create and sell bonds.",

          "details": "## Quadratic Funding\nhttps://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1220\n\nCreated by Glen Wyel at Microsoft and Vitalik Buterin founder of Ethereum, with this mechanism you have a crowdfunding campaign that is allocated dollars from a central matching pool based on which projects are more democratically supported as opposed to those into which more capital goes. It is in opposition to 1:1 as that is plutocratic and based only on capital needs. It is instead based on the number of contributors as opposed to the amount funded, reducing whale power and favoring democratic.\nExample: You raise a grant that gets $100 from 100 contributors, and I raise a grant that gets $100 from 1 contributor, despite both grants being donated $100, you will get 99% of the matching pool. Itâs a cool mechanism because it is a collective intelligence mechanism that routes money to where the  âpoor and the manyâ have an advantage over the rich and the few.\n\nYou may give âonlyâ a dollar, but really you are part of building an aggregate signal of what public goods folks want to see funded. Problems:\n* sybil attacks, needing to raise matching pool funds.\n* Itâs like voting! Mitigating a plutocratic methodology with a one person: one vote identity style.\n\n\n## Retroactive Public Goods Funding \nhttps://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=1680\n\nKarl Floersch is an inspiration for this mechanism, as they are implementing it at Optimism. It is a way of doing public goods funding retroactively. At Optimism, they are creating a committee of experts, and theyâre channeling revenue from the Optimism network and asking that committee of experts which things in the past have delivered value to the ecosystem. The idea is that more talent will be directed toward developing public goods funding in the present based on the assurance that they will be rewarded for it in the future.\n\n## Hypercerts \nhttps://youtu.be/qyd7mvQmn5I?t=2680\nOwocki is working on this mechanism with Protocol Labs. Carbon credits have market value; Hypercerts can generalize the magic of carbon credits into any impact vector. For example, I fix some potholes or pick up x-amount trash, etc. Any impact DAO could issue Hypercerts when their members have positive impact, and then bootstrap a marketplace of impact evaluators and get people who want to collect Hypercerts to show their virtue. Web2 = virtue-signaling. Web3 = proof-of-virtue.\n\nSo weâre bootstrapping a triple-sided marketplace, where impact DAOs can issue Hypercerts, impact evaluators can stamp their legitimacy, and people who care can purchase them. Sum value is that any impact DAO can go from worrying about how much impact they can capture to how much they can create. That systematically shifts the incentives towards impact DAOs to having a business model, which means more capital and talent can rotate into impact DAOs. If you can create a decentralized signal generation collective intelligence marketplace, where people are issuing, evaluating and purchasing Hypercerts, you can have a decentralized data source about the impact.\n\nChallenge: why havenât they worked in the past? Impact markets arenât new. Owocki thinks the decentralized, blockchain aspect will make it reliable and successful. Bootstrapping the buy pressure will be the hardest part. We need to use social and cultural power to collect these things, then theyâll be successful. The dream is to create a market around it.\n\n## References\n- https://medium.com/giveth/coordination-mechanisms-notes-from-a-conversation-with-griff-green-kevin-owocki-af95f3e831b1",

In chicken bonds, users bond an amount of the protocol tokens in turn for virtually accruing newly issued boosted tokens (bTokens) which have a higher return than the yield on the underlying token.  After some time has passed, the user can decide whether to mint the bTokens which have accrued virtually and give up their possession of the underlying tokens (Chicken-in) or to cancel the bond and get back their principal amount of the underlying token (Chicken-out). Different stages of the bond are expressed via artwork as NFTs, these NFTs can be transferred and point to the bond, meaning whoever owns the NFT is in possession of the bond. The longer a bond has been going on for, the rarer the NFT it is associated with.  The bTokens can either be redeemed for the underlying tokens from the protocol, or be swapped in a DEX depending on whichever is more profitable to the user. Moreover, the bTokens can be bought in DEXs as a form of investment if the user believes in the long term appreciation of its value. \n\nNow that we have briefly introduced what chicken bonds are, let us dive a little deeper and see how they work behind the scenes and some of its advantages.\n"

          "shortTitle": "Learnings",
          "details": "### Learnings\n\nIt is understood that the user bonds the protocol tokens in return for a virtual accrual of bTokens which the user can choose to claim (Chicken-in) or not (Chicken-out). But the question of how the bTokens provide more yield than the underlying tokens and how it is feasible for the protocol arises. To answer that, we need to understand where the bonded underlying tokens go. But first let us have a brief overview of the bonding itself.\n\nUsers can benefit from the system by,\n* **Bonding:** The user can make a profit by bonding, achieving breakeven and then redeeming the bTokens\n\n* **Investing:** Buy the bTokens on the market as a long-term investment with amplified returns and limited downside risks.\n* **Sell the bond:** Sell the chicken-bond NFTs in NFT market places.\n\n\n\nAt any point in time, the holder of the bond can decide to:\n* **Claim bond (Chicken In):** claim and mint the accrued balance of bTokens in exchange for the deposited tokens.\n* **Cancel bond (Chicken Out):** retrieve the deposited tokens (principal) forgoing the accrued balance of bTokens.\n* **Users can sell their bonds:** Represented as NFTs on the secondary market like OpenSea. This especially makes sense for bonds that have accrued a significant amount of bTokens without breaking even yet.\nNow that we have that clear,  let us see where the bonded tokens go and how it aids in the bTokens achieving a boosted yield.\n**Buckets**\n\nBuckets are reserves of the underlying token. There are three âbucketsâ of tokens where the bonded tokens are held. Think of these as an internal segregation of assets by the protocol to have better clarity over how much assets they hold and make use of in different aspects of the chicken bond. \n\nThese are Pending, Reserve and Permanent buckets. The protocol generates yield on the tokens from all three buckets and this yield from all the three buckets is funneled into the Reserve bucket and bTokens can be redeemed for a pro-rata ratio of the Reserve bucket.\n\n**Flow**\n\nFirst, when a user bonds their tokens, the tokens are sent to the Pending bucket. Then, depending on whether the user chickens in, the âchickened-inâ funds are sent to the other two buckets, Reserve and Permanent.\n\nThe tokens in the Reserve bucket are directly responsible for the backing of the generated bTokens, while the tokens in the Permanent bucket are permanently owned by the system and are used to generate yield to be funneled into the Reserve bucket. \n\n**Boosted yield**\n\n**Backing ratio never decreases**\n\nWhenever somebody Chickens In, the protocol expands the bToken supply in the same proportion as it increases the Reserve Bucket backing them. Let us see how.  The protocol makes sure that the backing ratio, given by ``tokens in reserve bucket / boosted token supply`` never decreases. This means that whenever there is a chicken-in event and bTokens are minted, the amount of underlying tokens sent to the reserve will be such that the backing ratio never decreases (or remains the same as it was before the chicken-in event). \n\nThis is done by levying a maximum cap (as we saw on the graph) on the amount of bTokens generated according to the current backing rate. The cap is defined as ``boosted_token_supply/reserve_bucket ``. \n\nTo better understand, let us consider an example  For instance, letâs assume a user bonds 120 TKN, and the current backing ratio is 1.5. Therefore the cap for that bond would be 80 bTKN (= 120 / 1.5). After some time and reaching **80%** of the cap the user claims the bond. So the system mints 64 bTKN for the user, and the bonded amount is split in 96 TKN **(80%)** which go to the Reserve Bucket, and 24 TKN (the remaining 20%) which are deposited in the Permanent bucket.\n\n**Boosted yield and rising price floor**\n\nOn top of the yield token always being backed at a set minimum ratio per each chicken-in event, the Reserve bucket is constantly accruing yield from the other two buckets which means that the backing ratio keeps increasing as time passes. For example, say at some time T, we had a backing ratio 1.5, at some time T+X we would have a higher backing ratio, say 2. Because the backing ratio never decreases per chicken-in event and on top of that, the amount of underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket keeps increasing owing to yield from the tokens in the other two buckets. \n\nRemember, bTokens can be redeemed for a pro-rata ratio of the Reserve bucket. Since the number of underlying tokens in the Reserve bucket increases faster than the total number of bTokens according to the above logic, a scenario where the price floor for the bTokens keeps increasing is created (Meaning the amount of underlying tokens redeemable for the given amount of bTokens keeps increasing, theoretically). \n\n**Summary and the flywheel effect**\n\nTo sum up, Given that the yield from all three buckets is sent to the Reserve Bucket, the backing ratio (price floor) will grow faster than the value of a simple portfolio of the underlying token. By pricing in the amplified growth, the bTokens should trade at a premium against their price floor, driving a flywheel: the more people bond, the more yield is retained for the bToken holders. A higher yield in turn increases the price premium, making bonding more attractive through a higher APR.\n\nTo ensure that bonding remains attractive when the premium drops, the protocol may automatically adjust the accrual rate (steepness of the accrual curve) using a controller targeting an average Chicken In time or bond age.\n"

We have seen that in staking, protocols initially offer a very high APR to attract users to deposit tokens in their reserves and thus deepen their Protocol Owned Liquidity which can help the protocol in gaining stability for their token, and credibility in the market. But these high APRs are often unsustainable and as soon as the protocol starts offering a more practical APR on staking, the users start pulling out their funds since they no longer find this to be a profitable investment. In this system we see that the protocol cannot reward users for their prolonged participation, as the APR is likely to decrease in the long run. \nOn the other hand, chicken bonds help protocols deepen their liquidity by providing a novel bonding mechanism which rewards users for their long term participation while simultaneously deepening their Protocol Owned Liquidity. Ofcourse, on the user side of things there is always the issue of volatility of the bToken or the underlying token in DEXs which could mean that user incurs a loss but in theory, the user can yield more with the bToken than they would with the underlying token which is an attractive offer for the users holding the underlying token, who are the target users for this mechanism. \n \nHelps deepen the liquidity of the protocol, and to hold a soft peg. \nThe bond has no maturity, meaning the user can choose to reap the benefits or quit if they do not find it to be profitable at anytime, which is often not possible in staking. This makes chicken bonds more attractive to users.\nThe user can obtain dynamic NFTs whose rarity can vary depending on the time that has passed since chickening in, etc. These NFTs are proof of ownership of the bonds, meaning that the bonds can be sold and bought in markets, opening new investment opportunities.\nOther options of generating liquidity often involve recurring expenses from the protocol, which is unsustainable unless there is a lot of funding for the protocol. But in the case of chicken bonds, all the protocol needs to capture liquidity is time, and ofcourse users to bond, the users will start using chicken bonds when they realize that it is worthwhile.\n\nAn example of the advantage of bTokens with the use of bLUSD. Say LUSD is trading at a price premium to its $1 peg, as long as LUSD is trading above its peg, users will mint LUSD and try to take advantage of arbitrage. With bLUSD, users can get compounded yield on LUSD which makes the arbitrage option more attractive. This way, as long as there is a price premium for LUSD, users will be more incentivized to invest it in chicken bonds and reap more benefits. While simultaneously, the LUSD liquidity will be deepened, making it stabler and helping to reduce the price premium, which is what is expected of a stablecoin (to trade at peg value).\n"

          "details": "### Drawbacks using LUSD/bLUSD as an example\n\nLike with all protocols, the b.protocol (chicken-bonds) also has its own downsides. Let us look at a few of them with the help of Liquity as an example.\n\nSometimes, it could be more profitable to chicken out and simply buy bLUSD in an exchange than to accrue it from being bonded. Also, the idea of rebonding (redeeming bToken from a previous bond to bond again with a larger amount of underlying token) can sometimes prove to be too time taking and providing very little yield in the end whereas the user can just buy bLUSD and become an LP for a better yield (a user would rebond only when the bLUSD value has achieved breakeven with the LUSD invested, which can take a long time sometimes). Though as people chicken out to buy bLUSD, the rebond time to make a profitable chicken-in decreases, but the user can chicken out and not buy bLUSD at all, users might face loss in such a scenario.\n\n\nbLUSD is often trading at a premium, if user buys bLUSD to become LP in a curve pool, it is very likely that the user will not be able to cover the premium that they paid using the APY being offered by being an LP. Also, it is interesting to note that as users chicken-out, the APY for bLUSD supply decreases. In the first scenario, the only other option for the user to make any progress with bLUSD being buying it in an exchange and becoming LP is again not solid, since the APY for the bLUSD supply will decrease and the bLUSD premium will be too much for the reducing APY to cover. In other words, if the rebonding proves to be not profitable, or time taking, the user might want to become bLUSD LP, but that option is also not great since the bLUSD price and the APY it earns are not at par with each other (you would want more APY than the bLUSD premium price).\n"
