## Intoduction
 
In this chapter we will explore the different models that various projects can use to raise capital. Each model has different use cases. Some of these are for raising the initial funds, some for public good projects, some for research-based projects, and a few for acquiring liquidity in DeFi projects. 

By understanding the different options available to you, you can choose the best model for your project and ensure that you have a solid plan for raising the necessary funds.
