## Chicken bonds
 
Liquidity mining comes with a few drawbacks - the main one being that even after receiving rewards, liquidity providers still have 100% control over their liquidity and can choose to pull out of the protocol at any time. In fact, past patterns show that most of the liquidity providers do leave the protocol within a couple of days after the rewards are reduced or stopped.

Bonds offer a great alternative for protocols that want to own 100% of their liquidity. This chapter discusses Chicken Bonds, which is one implementation of "DeFi Bonds."
